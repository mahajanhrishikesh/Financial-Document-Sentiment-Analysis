Edited excerpt:

Q) It seems like the markets seem to have witnessed profit-taking at higher levels. What led to the sharp sell-off on D-Street and then some recovery towards the close of the week?

A) Till last Thursday, everything was okay, but certain domestic, as well as global developments, brought negativity in the equity markets.

Domestic factors like an extension of the lockdown and the government not coming up with stimulus package, brought nervousness in the market, while the ongoing quarterly results and the management commentary were not encouraging.

Apart from this, the US decision of imposing a new tariff on China in response to the COVID-19 pandemic has brought negativity across the global equity markets.

We reiterate our stand of not being optimistic on the market rally, but here will be stock specific movement in the markets.

Q) Any factors which investors should watch out for in the coming week?

A) There are no major events lined-up next week. But, on the domestic front, earning results will be tracked by the investors next week. On the global front, lockdown relaxation across major economies will be considered.

Any development of the medical solution to the Covid-19 will be taken positively by the investors. Markets are likely to be range-bound over the next few trading sessions.

Q) Another mega-deal in RIL’s Jio platform. What are your views and estimates on the stock, and what should investor’s do – buy, sell or hold?

A) Any news related to funding infusion in debt-laden RIL will be taken positively by the investors. Considering the quantum of funds to be raised in Q1 FY21 and the continued attractiveness of the strategic investors on its technology platforms, the outlook on RIL is positive.

The stock has ran-up already and is expected to be range-bound, till the right issue is executed. Investors are recommended to buy on every dip.

Disclaimer: Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media & Investments Ltd.

Q) Small & Midcaps outperform in the week gone by. Looks like investors are slowly accumulating beaten down names?

A) The small & midcap have outperformed last week, considering the valuation gap between these and the large-cap stock, we are recommending investors to accumulate large-cap stocks.

If also there is a positive reversal, the rally will be narrow and these large caps will be in demand.

Q) Moody's says India's negative rating outlook reflects a rising risk of slower GDP growth. Do you think this is already factored in or will it weigh on markets and investor decision making?

A) We don’t think the market has fully factored in the lockdown impact on economic growth and that’s why we are not optimistic on the market movement. We are forecasting an economic contraction in FY21.

Q) Do you think lockdown could get extended beyond May 17? If yes, what is the kind of impact it could have on markets?

A) Analyzing the growth in the virus infections across major cities in India, we feel that there will be no pan-India lockdown after 17th May. But major impacted cities would remain in lockdown. This should be taken negatively by the market.

Q) Specialty Chemicals, Pharma best-placed sectors do ride out of COVID-19 storm. But, after a swift rally, are these still a good buy at current levels? What should investors do?

A) Not confident about the specialty chemicals rally, but pharma rally seems to get extended in these uncertain times. Thus investors are recommended to remain invested in the pharma stocks.

5,"May 12, 2020 01:57 PM IST",Kshitij Anand,India in a Bear Market! We continue to focus on LQV companies for investments: Unmesh Kulkarni,"A) We are currently in a ‘Bear Market’, which started with the steep fall in March.
Some of the IT companies will benefit from changing business models and personal lifestyles (work from home) as well as the potential for increased outsourcing by global companies (from a cost reduction perspective).
From an investment strategy perspective, we continue to focus on LQV companies, i.e., companies that are ‘Leaders’ (L) in their respective sectors, with good ‘Quality’ of business + execution track record (Q) and are available at reasonable ‘Valuations’ (V).
A) FIIs were big sellers in March, as risk appetite collapsed amidst the rout in global markets.
Global markets have taken all these developments positively and marched ahead with a “sense of hope”.","From an investment strategy perspective, we continue to focus on LQV companies, i.e., companies that are ‘Leaders’ (L) with good ‘Quality’ of business and are available at reasonable ‘Valuations’ (V),","Industrial/Infrastructure spending can also see a pushback due to a decline in utilization levels and lower spending capacity/intent, in both the private and public sectors. And with the overall global slowdown, sectors such as commodities, shipping, and a certain type of exports are going to take some time to revive.

Financial services are likely to be affected this year with (a) overall demand coming down (b) risk of delinquencies going up among retail borrowers and (c) corporate stress going up, pulling down credit growth.

Demand for “services” of various types could also be affected as companies get into a cost-reduction mode. Trade, tourism/travel, and entertainment would be directly affected by spending cuts, social distancing, and curbs (forced or voluntary) on travel and cross-border movement of goods and people.

While there is some case for pent-up demand to show up just after lockdowns are lifted, the overall discretionary spend is likely to take a hit due to the potential loss of employment/income as well as overall prevailing uncertainty; this will keep demand for autos and some other high-ticket consumption items in check.

A) The COVID-19 pandemic and its economic impact are likely to put some medium-term brakes, both domestic and cross-border, on lifestyle and businesses, even after the lockdowns are lifted.

Consequently, the resultant effects may also include liquidity crunch, besides reduced domestic consumption. Prolonged social distancing could potentially disrupt capital formation, and ultimately labour participation and productivity.

The second-order impact would come from the countrywide lockdown and social distancing, driving factory closures/lower utilisations, reduced labour wage growth, travel bans, and decimated retail consumption. This will weigh on sectors such as retailers, aviation & airport operators, hospitality & tourism, and roads.

The impact on the economy is likely to unfold in stages. The first-order effect would come from the global slowdown and trade disruptions, with sectors such as textiles, automobile parts/components and commodities taking a direct hit in their revenue growth, as volumes and realizations will come under pressure.

The corporate earnings recovery story has been pushed back by a year, and we might see another level of reset in the Indian economy thanks to the COVID-19 related disruption.

Early results of Q4FY20 earnings season and management commentaries suggest more volatility and disruption in earnings ahead with several companies refraining from providing any sort of guidance till more clarity emerges.

In a way, demand has been destroyed as people will like to postpone certain discretionary spending because of a fall in income, loss of jobs, or even due to some sense of insecurity.

A) The COVID-19 episode and the lockdowns are likely to have a severe impact on the economy, for at least a couple of quarters, as it will take time for several parts of the economy to revive and return to pre-COVID levels in terms of demand and growth.

For markets to develop new optimism, we need the lockdowns to end, human and economic activity to resume and some longer-term support from the Government for the beleaguered part of the economy to accelerate the revival in demand and growth.

This is why the markets may lack direction over the next couple of quarters; in other words, we are currently in a sell-on-rise type of market.

We currently have a neutral view on the Indian equity markets. While we feel that the markets have bottomed out in the panic of March, we think that the markets need time to digest the actual impact of the COVID-19 in terms of the extent of the slowdown, any systemic stress, and the impact on earnings.

The hope that the Indian government would announce some major fiscal package(s) for the people as well as for businesses. And, as that has not exactly materialised, the rally seems to be fizzling out from early May.

While the March crash was because of fear of the unknown, the April rally was driven by hope. I hope that some antidote/vaccine would be announced somewhere in the world; hope that people would soon return to work.

A) We are currently in a ‘Bear Market’, which started with the steep fall in March. With the onset of COVID-19 and the pursuant lockdowns, there is no doubt that the economy will take a sizeable hit and so will earnings across the board.

Q) The market seems to be taking one step forward and two steps back. What we saw in April was largely a bear market rally and at the beginning of May, we saw most of the gains evaporating. What are your views on markets in the near term?

From an investment strategy perspective, we continue to focus on LQV companies, i.e., companies that are ‘Leaders’ (L) in their respective sectors, with good ‘Quality’ of business + execution track record (Q) and are available at reasonable ‘Valuations’ (V), Unmesh Kulkarni – Managing Director Senior Advisor, Julius Baer India, said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.

On the other hand, industries that are focused on essential consumption or which benefit from any changes in lifestyle post-COVID, are likely to be beneficiaries (to some extent). Demand for FMCG and staples will continue to hold up (though from the equity investment perspective their valuations are rich).

Pharmaceuticals and healthcare are likely to do well as (a) healthcare needs will stay high (incl. some preventive demand on account of COVID) (b) the US FDA seemingly becoming a bit relaxed in granting approvals to Indian pharma companies and (c) from equity market perspective, the sector had languished for about five years and had become relatively under-owned; hence, it is likely to be an out-performer in the near-to-medium term.

Some of the IT companies will benefit from changing business models and personal lifestyles (work from home) as well as the potential for increased outsourcing by global companies (from a cost reduction perspective). Here, opportunities could emerge in areas such as digital transformation and cloud migration as well as vendor consolidation, although on-site services will suffer due to restrictions on the movement of people.

The Telecom sector is already a clear beneficiary of the work-from-home environment, and the demand for internet services and entertainment is likely to continue post-COVID as people adjust to changes in lifestyle.

We believe that across industries, large corporates with strong balance sheets will likely withstand this onslaught, and will eventually gain market share at the cost of marginal players who could struggle for the next year.

From an investment strategy perspective, we continue to focus on LQV companies, i.e., companies that are ‘Leaders’ (L) in their respective sectors, with good ‘Quality’ of business + execution track record (Q) and are available at reasonable ‘Valuations’ (V).

A) The current environment poses a challenge for growth; at the same time, there are concerns around liquidity and systemic stability, as there is a disruption in cashflows, supply-chain, and credit flows.

In such times, investors should ideally position their portfolios in favour of quality, safety, and liquidity.

With respect to the overall asset allocation, while it may be tempting to move away from equities in the current times of uncertainty, it would be in the best interest of investors to stay aligned with their strategic (long-term) asset allocation, as the longer-term potential of equities remains intact, and markets should gradually revert to their normal average by 2021.

Investors need to extend their time horizon, as equities may be range-bound (with a downward bias) over the next few months, while markets digest the data points emerging around growth and earnings.

Investors who are underweight equities in their portfolios could buy into market declines; on the other hand, investors should cut any overweight allocation to equities that they may have built over the last couple of years.

Within equities, a safer strategy would be large-cap companies and large cap-oriented equity funds, or at best multi-cap funds, as well as index funds.

Within fixed income, stay with short-to-medium term AAA debt fund strategies or AAA bonds; avoid both high yield and duration. High yield is likely to stay under pressure owing to the slowing economy, stress in balance sheets, and illiquidity in the secondary debt markets.

Duration strategies may be volatile as there is likely to be upward pressure on long-term yields owing to the large borrowing programme announced recently by the Government, and the expected jump in the fiscal deficit.

Q) How are FIIs positioned with respect to India? Do you foresee further selloff from the foreign investors?

A) FIIs were big sellers in March, as risk appetite collapsed amidst the rout in global markets. In April, with global markets as well as India staging a smart comeback, the FII selling abated to a large extend, although flows were still negative; the domestic flows primarily led the equity market rally.

Going forward, the road is expected to be bumpy. For foreign investors to turn optimistic on India, they will watch out for some long-term signals with respect to:(a) Covid-19 peaking out in India (we are still in the “up” trajectory),(b) lockdowns getting lifted and economic activity resuming (some part withdrawal of lockdown has just started, but we have still some time to go) and

(c) strong support from the Government and the RBI to revive growth and demand, as well as stabilize financial markets.

Given the extension of lockdowns and therefore the deeper impact on the economy and earnings, the FII activity is likely to be tepid for a few months, unless the Government steps in with some major package to revive demand and improve business sentiment.

Unless there is a global flow of liquidity towards equities as an asset class, including Emerging Market equities, in which case India could also benefit.

A) As of now, it looks like we created the bottom in the markets – both globally and in India – on 23rd March. This was the time when fear was at its peak, large-scale uncertainty was prevailing around the globe and Covid-19 was on the fast rise everywhere.

Since then, things have progressed on the Covid-19 front. Several countries in Europe have seen their Covid-19 cases flatten out, the US too looks heading in a similar direction and China already claims it has conquered the virus.

Lockdowns are expected to be lifted soon in several countries. There has been a massive support, both fiscal and monetary, by various global governments and central banks. And work is fast happening on the vaccine front, or at least with respect to some mitigants.

Global markets have taken all these developments positively and marched ahead with a “sense of hope”. The Nasdaq has already turned positive in 2020. As of 8th May, the S&P has recovered 31% from its bottom of 23rd March; India too is currently up 22% from its recent bottom.

We expect that markets will take a breather after the smart comeback, and may even witness a correction from current levels as the real impact on the economies and company earnings pans out in the coming weeks.

Globally, analysts now expect Q2 S&P 500 earnings to decline 37% against the same period last year, followed by a sequential rebound in Q3 and Q4 (the full year 2020, 18% decline).

However, for the next year, the consensus now expects a 28% earnings rebound, and S&P 500 profits to reach pre-crisis levels towards the end of Q2 2021. We expect that the S&P 500 will continue to gradually move up from current levels towards the year-end.

Given that governments and central bankers globally are all on the rescue job, it looks unlikely that markets will get into the same panic mode as we witnessed in March.

Back home, Indian markets will mostly follow the global sentiment, though we are likely to lag the global markets for some time owing to our lockdown being much more severe and therefore the economic and earnings recovery will take that much longer to bottom out.

A) The IMF expects the global economy to contract sharply by 3% in 2020, much worse than during the 2008-09 financial crisis, but expects it to rebound to 5.8% in CY21, helped by monetary and fiscal policy support. For India, the IMF has lowered the CY20 growth forecast to 1.9% from 5.8% estimated in Jan’20.

On average, every month of lockdown results in an output loss of ~8.5% of the annual total. If 75% of the economy is locked down for two months, the output loss will ~13%.

The severity of the economic impact from the lockdown necessitates a significant policy response from the RBI as well as the Government, to contain any near-term damages and provide the necessary impetus to revive growth and improve business sentiment.

Globally, most central banks and governments have already sprung into action and announced monetary and fiscal packages (totaling ~USD14tn) to deal with the aftermath of the Covid-19 crisis. In India, RBI has so far been on the forefront and has doled out a large rate cut (75 bps cut in repo) as well as several liquidity injection measures, to bring stability to the financial markets.

The government, on the other hand, released an Rs. 1.7 trillion packages for the poor, as its initial policy response. However, much more is desired to support the frail economy.

It is widely expected that the government will come up, after due analysis, with a comprehensive fiscal package for the larger part of the economy, including the industry and small-scale enterprises.

The practical challenge that the Government faces is that its revenues are under severe strain, so any financing of the fiscal package will have to be done out of market borrowings.

Recently, the Government announced a hike in its borrowing programme for FY21 to Rs. 12 trillion (earlier announced Rs. 7.8 trillion), which is a signal that a package is soon on its way.

While that would be good news for the country and temporarily for the equity markets, it will leave the bond markets greatly worried, as the fiscal deficit will likely jump from 3.5% of GDP to 5.5% (est.).

Here too, the RBI will have to play a crucial role in monetizing some of the borrowings so that the overall bond supply in the markets reduces.

SRCM reported Q4FY20 earnings in line with our estimates. Company depicted strong maturity over last one year with tight discipline on volumes and prices in its Northern operations. This is reflected in highest ever margins since FY09 and best ever absolute bottom line. However, we see material downside risk to SRCM's margins due to competition from new capacities, weak demand outlook and increased likelihood of leakage on volumes coupled with widening gap between A and C category brands. Company raised Rs24bn in Q3FY20 through QIP of equity to fund capacity expansion despite quality B/S and strong cash flow generation. Overcapacity and weak demand would delay SRCM's capacity creation and hence, the RoE profile due to idle cash loaded in the B/S.

Outlook

Peaked out margins, slowing growth and stretched valuations (EV/EBITDA of 16.7x and P/E of 33x FY22E) leaves no scope for margin of safety. Hence, we maintain Hold with TP of Rs16,900 (earlier Rs16,680).

""Total industry volume up 47 percent to 3.7 million tonne, driven by preponement of purchase, healthy underlying demand and low base.

Brokerage firm Edelweiss Securities has buy recommendations on Dhanuka Agritech and Coromandel International among the agro-chem players.",The fertiliser sector is likely to see positive growth due to healthy underlying demand as India's agricultural sector is seen as less effected by the coronavirus outbreak.,"The coronavirus outbreak has pushed most sectors to their lowest lows but there is one segment that is clocking impressive growth, thanks to healthy underlying demand.

Fertiliser sales were up 47 percent in April, brokerage firm Prabhudas Lilladher has said in a report.

""Total industry volume up 47 percent to 3.7 million tonne, driven by preponement of purchase, healthy underlying demand and low base. Urea/NPK/DAP sales are at 2 million tonne/5.9 million tonne/7 million tonne, up 27 percent/102 percent/95 percent, respectively. SSP volumes up 51 percent to 2.7 million tonne,"" the brokerage said.

Among the players, Coromandel International’s volumes were up 194 percent YoY, Chambal up 69 percent and GSFC’s volumes were 15 percent higher, the report said.

Demand to remain healthy

The sector is likely to see positive growth due to healthy underlying demand as India's agriculture sector has not been hit as badly as the industry by the coronavirus outbreak.

Besides, both the Centre and state governments have been responding to the challenges in agriculture value chain posed by the COVID-19 outbreak, which is a positive.

The government has taken several steps to ensure that the farm sector remains on track and a good rabi season has resulted in a spike in receivables of most agrochemical players.

The outlook for the Kharif season is also positive with the met department predicting a normal monsoon.

""IMD’s forecast indicates that India’s seasonal monsoon rainfall is likely to be normal (96-104 percent) of the long period average, with a likelihood of above-normal rain in August and September 2020. Rabi harvesting has been encouraging, with nearly 40 percent of the crop already purchased by the government and other private institutions and disbursements being transferred to the farmers,"" brokerage firm Kotak Institutional Equities said.

The challenges

The biggest challenge for the fertiliser industry is the liquidity crunch in the rural sector.

Timely disbursements are critical to mitigate tight these conditions and enable robust offtake for agri-inputs for Kharif.

""Cash flows of farmers have taken a hit as several mandis remain closed due to the lockdown. Dip in realisation of produce has further worsened woes. However, procurement by the government at MSP rates is likely to ease their liquidity woes,"" said Edelweiss Securities.

The brokerage expects surplus production to improve farmer’s overall income.

Experts highlight that the fertiliser players may not see a similar magnitude of sales in Rabi season due to stretched working capital.

""The increase in volume in April sales was due to the higher acreage of sowing, especially in paddy and cereals. But the sector has very limited companies that will be able to see a similar level of sales in Rabi season due to stretched working capital,"" said Sameer Kalra, Founder, Target Investing.

Stocks to buy

Brokerage firm Prabhudas has buy recommendations on Bayer Cropscience, Dhanuka Agritech, Godrej Agrovet, Insecticides India and UPL.

While Asian Paints will benefit from the pullback in input costs and can re-invest the same to drive volume growth, it assumes 7 percent average higher volume growth in FY22/23E (at 2.3-2.5x real GDP growth), equates to an implied valuation suggesting 32 percent downside, the research firm said.

edited excerpt:

Q) It seems like the markets seem to have witnessed profit-taking at higher levels. What led to a sharp sell-off on D – street and then some recovery to the close of the week?

A) Indian stock markets fell on both local as well as global cues. On the global front, the US President Donald Trump criticizing China’s handling of the Coronavirus pandemic unnerved investors, and on the domestic front, an extension of the nationwide lockdown dampened the sentiment.

Stocks dropped globally after the US President on Sunday said that Beijing misled the world about COVID-19.

On the domestic front, earnings and the economy would take time to revive even if all restrictions are lifted. The government may not ease the curbs anytime soon considering the number of new cases we are seeing every day.

All the above factors turned the investor's sentiments negative fuelled by global tensions which eventually led to the downfall of Nifty.

Global market trends turned positive following attempts to defuse tensions around the US-China trade talks, which ultimately led to the recovery of the domestic markets. Markets seem to be awaiting the announcement of a stimulus package from the government.

A) The market has been trying to move up, and now with global markets also bouncing back, investors are now feeling that the time for value buying has arrived.

The partial relaxation granted to less affected areas from lockdown will be helpful in reviving the economy in certain aspects and therefore investors seem to accumulate these stocks, but selling pressure likely at higher levels in small & midcap space.

A) Nifty’s movement next week may depend on the progress in the COVID-19 vaccine, hopes of a bigger fiscal stimulus from the government, expectations of a decline in daily novel Coronavirus cases.

There is likely to be some stock-specific action due to earnings. Volatility may remain higher in the coming week. Small and midcap stocks may witness selling pressure at higher levels.

A) The oil giant company has a firm belief that the data will be the next oil and it has been focusing more on the same platform.

With the introduction of Reliance Jio which had disrupted the telecom business, it had been continuously entering different sectors and making progress aggressively.

Many companies struggle to raise funds and for them, it might take years but that is not the case with Reliance Jio which is among one of the high values companies in India.

Within a short span of time, it has raised more than Rs. 60,000 cr. The latest deal is with the Vista Equity Partners for a stake of 2.32 percent which is valued around Rs. 11,000 cr.

The deals with tech giant Facebook which they combined planning to enter to the various businesses especially focusing on UPI payment platform and retail has boosted the valuation of the Reliance Industries.

We recommend investors to hold their position for the long term as the stock is expected to outperform the index.

Disclaimer: Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media & Investments Ltd.

A) In November 2019 Moody’s has downgraded India’s outlook from stable to negative with respect to the lower economic growth.

On Friday, in revision to that Moody’s stated that “India's rating outlook reflects the rising risk of slower GDP growth, low policy effectiveness.”

The already slow economic growth, less job creation, high debt burdens, and credit crunch among NBFC and others have highly contributed, in addition to that the outbreak of Coronavirus and the extension of lockdown had been highly impacted the economy of India.

On Friday, the benchmark indices have ended at 9521.50 or 0.57 percent positive. From the day's performance, we may conclude that the market has already discounted the Moody’s rating about India and investors are still in hope for another stimulus package and closely watching various treatment and vaccine options to the COVID-19.

A) With a growing number of cases of COVID 19 and the situation not getting under control, it looks like the lockdown will be extended in many parts of the country which are getting COVID-19 cases on a regular basis.

The situation is very dire, with no medicine/vaccine, and lockdown seems to be the only available and possible way to flatten the curve. This makes the probability of lockdown extension very high, at least for the affected areas.

Lockdown has already taken a toll on the economy. However, the lockdown may be relaxed in certain places and this would have mixed effects on markets and would make market choppier.

A) The COVID-19 panic has set pharma stocks on fire. Countries at present are halting exports of essential drugs, but this is only temporary. In the long term, the risk from protectionism on India's low-cost export model will be countered by its sheer price competitiveness.

After this pandemic, there could be significantly higher spending both by the government and private sector on healthcare, specialty chemicals, and pharmaceuticals.

There are supply-side challenges but the overall outlook is positive and hence investors can add these stocks (at dip) to their basket.

Berkshire Hathaway may have reported a loss of about $50 billion in the first quarter, but Warren Buffett is still sitting on a cash pile of more than $100 billion.
Warren Buffett also confirmed that Berkshire in April sold its “entire positions” in the four-largest airlines, and said that he ""made a mistake"".
Warren Buffett's letter to shareholders, as well as commentary during quarterly results, are considered sacred text for value investor community.
“Warren Buffett was already sitting on a cash pile of over $100 billion throughout last year and raised around $6 billion from the airline sale proceeds.","Experts suggest that it is difficult to fundamentally measure the exact top and bottom of the market, but one can hold on to some dry powder in these uncertain times.","When legendary investors like Warren Buffett do something, the world tunes in and takes notes. Berkshire Hathaway may have reported a loss of about $50 billion in the first quarter, but Warren Buffett is still sitting on a cash pile of more than $100 billion.

Berkshire's cash stake was at $137.3 billion in the January-March quarter, reflecting the difficulty in finding good places to invest, said a Reuters report. Warren Buffett also confirmed that Berkshire in April sold its “entire positions” in the four-largest airlines, and said that he ""made a mistake"".

Warren Buffett's letter to shareholders, as well as commentary during quarterly results, are considered sacred text for value investor community. And, this time is no different.

At a time when there is an environment of fear, and most equity markets across the globe including Indian have witnessed a fall of about 40 percent before recovering – the next big question is should we sit on cash.

We at Moneycontrol asked the same question to experts, fund managers and they agreed that Buffett's principles of sitting on cash make sense but for long-term wealth creation, your portfolio should be at least 35 percent invested into equities.

“The Oracle of Omaha is one person who has seen a lot of market cycles in his lifetime and no doubt has been one of the judicious investors in such uncertain time picking up companies offering long term value to its portfolio,” Hemang Kapasi, Portfolio Manager – Equity Investment Products, Sanctum Wealth Management Private Limited told Moneycontrol.

“Having said that the pandemic scenario and the probable impact on economies and sectors across would largely be felt in the days to come giving reasonable insights into the impact on various businesses which shall present opportunities to make more informed decisions,” he said.

Experts suggest that it is difficult to fundamentally measure the exact top and bottom of the market, but one can hold on to some dry powder in these uncertain times which can be effectively used if markets present an opportunity, they say.

Warren Buffett is a very large and long term investor, always invests in a big way if it is cheap compared to its intrinsic value and has strong earnings growth expectations in the coming decade.

“We as individual investors should look at our own assessment and needs for investment at regular periods of time. A certain part of cash should always be kept in the portfolio for crisis or unforeseen times of an individual,” Vikas Jain, Senior Research Analyst at Reliance Securities told Moneycontrol.

“Well as broader markets and indices have moved up in the range of 25-30 percent from bottoms in a very short span of 30 days there could be some profit booking or pullbacks in overall markets with respect to the earnings season and we could inch lower from current levels,” he said.

Jain further added that this could be a good opportunity to invest in equities as an asset class for better returns over a longer time frame of more than 5-7 years as other assets could be less risky but rewards are also very meagre to beat the consumer inflation.

How much should be invested?

Keeping some cash aside is always a good idea for equity investors. And, at the same time, investors should avoid investing or trading with borrowed money.

If someone plans to construct a fresh portfolio then investing at current levels might be a good idea, for the rest who are already invested portfolio allocation is the discipline that needs to be followed to realign portfolio.

A minimum of 30-35 percent exposure to equities would not be bad, hence, investors should realign their asset allocation if required, suggest experts.

“Warren Buffett was already sitting on a cash pile of over $100 billion throughout last year and raised around $6 billion from the airline sale proceeds. Compared to the cash pile in the past year, the recent incremental cash is a smaller sum,” Nirali Shah, Senior Research Analyst, Samco Securities told Moneycontrol.

“Exiting equities completely and sitting on cash would be unwise, instead Indian investors should keep an eye on quality stocks which have corrected significantly and whose business models are expected to remain strong post-COVID as future investment bets. 35 percent exposure to equities in such times would be a safer approach,” she said.

""Ticket booking counters at the railway stations shall remain closed and no counter tickets (including platform tickets) shall be issued. Only passengers with valid confirmed tickets will be allowed to enter the railway stations,"" the government has said.

Prabhudas Lilladher expects company to report a 17.6 percent sequential decline in adjusted profit, 15 percent in revenue and 17 percent in EBITDA for the quarter ended March 2020, largely due to COVID-19-led shutdown.

COVID-led shutdown is expected to lead to a revenue loss of 15-20 days in March quarter, the brokerage said, adding IRCTC's fixed monthly operating expenses burn is in the region of Rs 42-52 crore.

But IRCTC is debt-free and had cash balance of Rs 1,160 crore as of December 2019. Thus, Prabhudas Lilladher believes company can meet its fixed cost obligations from current cash pile without any strain on balance sheet.

The primary trend has been bullish with higher tops and higher bottoms on the daily and weekly charts.","After bearish development on the short-term charts, Nifty has not seen follow up selling. The level of 9,100 has been acting as strong support for the index.","Vinay Rajani

For the last five sessions, Nifty has been trying to sustain above 9,100 and has been consolidating in the narrow range of 9,200 and 9,270 on a closing basis.

After bearish development on the short-term charts, Nifty has not seen follow up selling. The level of 9,100 has been acting as strong support for the index.

Any level below 9,116 could result in selling momentum in the Nifty.

Below 9,116, the index could slide to the next supports of 8,980 and 8,700, which happens to be 38.2 percent and 50 percent retracement of the entire rise seen from 7,511 to 9,889.

On the upside, the range of 9,500-9,550 could act as a resistance, where calls have been written and an 'Island' unfilled gap is placed.

Daily MACD Indicator has been struggling to move above its zero line. Daily DMI Indicator has also reached the contraction zone after the positive move, which indicates weakness in the short-term trend.

Breadth Indicators on the Nifty500 daily chart is giving the sign of market weakening. New high low index and MCclellan Summation Index have turned bearish on the daily chart.

This has happened for the first time after March 5, 2020, when the bullish signal was generated by the same indicators.

It is advisable to remain cautious on the market. Any level below 9,116 could bring momentum selling in the Nifty, which could drag it towards 8,980 and 8,700 targets.

Pullbacks and rallies should be utilised to lighten long commitments. However, the market would remain stock and sector-specific. Bearish markets are likely to be headed by the banking and finance sector, while pharma and IT would remain outperformers.

Here are three stock ideas for the next 3-4 weeks:

Sun Pharma | Buy | LTP: Rs 465.50 | Target price: Rs 510 | Stop loss: Rs 437 | Upside: 10%

The primary trend of the stock has been bullish as it has been forming higher tops and higher bottoms since March 2020.

The stock is trading above its 50, 100 and 200-DMA. It has reversed north from the previous top support on the weekly charts.

The relative strength of the stock has been significantly higher as compared to Nifty for the last many weeks. Weekly RSI and MACD have reached above their previous peaks and are showing strength in the trend.

The pharma sector looks strongest amongst the sectors.

Lupin | Buy | LTP: Rs 852.80 | Target price: Rs 920 | Stop loss: Rs 809 | Upside: 8%

After a few days of consolidation, the stock has resumed its primary uptrend. In the month of April 2020, it broke out from a long-term downward sloping trend line on the monthly charts.

This month, the stock should see follow up buying. It is placed above all important moving averages. Indicators and Oscillators are also showing strength in the trend.

Torrent Pharmaceuticals | Buy | LTP: Rs 2,506 | Target price: Rs 2,725 | Stop loss: Rs 2,350 | Upside: 9%

The stock has given a symmetrical triangle pattern breakout on the daily charts. It is very near to its all-time high.

The primary trend has been bullish with higher tops and higher bottoms on the daily and weekly charts. This stock is one of the best-performing stocks from the pharma sector.

Volumes have been rising along with the price rise for the last 4 sessions.

Strategy setup - Theta depreciating based iron condor in Nifty

Bulls and bears are fighting it out for their existence and the market has entered in short term trading range. After an initial fall in the previous week we didn't see the follow through on the downside and prices entered in a sideways zone. For an upcoming week, we expect the Index to be range bound as Moody’s negative outlook for India will act as hindrance for Nifty to participate in a pullback rally with its global peers apart from this; additional borrowing plan of 12 lakh crore by the government is dampening the bullish sentiments.

Simultaneous effect of downgrade fear and pullback scenario in global markets indicates that sideways move will continue and Nifty can move in the range of 8,900 to 9,500. Traders can deploy 'iron condor' in this scenario where OTM call and put option can be sold and to neutralise the positions deep OTM call and put options can be bought. It's one of the prudent strategy to trade the sideways market to gain the net premium amount in the form of theta decay.

Option chain analysis

Bulls seems to be slightly cautious as near ATM call option strike price of 9,300 have witnessed fresh open interest addition of more than 2,480 contracts and decent cumulative open interest of around 9,800 contracts also exist. Major resistance is shaping up at 9,500 as the same strike price call option holds maximum cumulative open interest of around 22,900 contracts. On the put side, immediate support level exist at 9,000 where 3,608 fresh contracts have been added in open interest and total open interest is now more than 15,850. Some confusion can also be seen on the part of bulls as unwinding of short positions in 9,200 and 8,900 Put option strike price can be seen. Option chain signifies the trading range of 9,000 to 9,500.

Technical structure

Sharp profit booking at higher levels and gap down opening on Monday’s trading session has resulted in the formation of 'island reversal' pattern. Though the follow up selling was missing and prices went sideways in the last few days and formed a trading range between 8,950 - 9,530.

Momentum indicators are trading in a sideways zone and suggesting that sideways move could continue for the next few days. There is an important concept of time cycle which cannot be ignored in the month of May as major moves have been registered in the market in this month. The range breakout if any, could result in dire implications and it should be kept in mind while taking any trade.

Trading strategy

Considering the overall scenario it's quite apparent that sideways move is expected in the next few days but keeping in mind the time cycle, cautious approach is required as breakout of a trading range could result in wild moves. Hence, “iron condor” strategy can be adopted where the risk is capped on both sides and decent gain can be availed in the form of theta decay if the market stays in a trading range.

Sell 8900 PE @ 52.55Sell 9500 CE @ 51.60Buy 9600 CE @ 31.30Buy 8800 PE @ 36.50Maximum gain - 36.35 points (if market remains in the range of 8900 to 9500)

Maximum loss - 63.65

Traders can avoid the risk reward as the profit probability in the strategy is quite high.

Note: Option premium resembles the closing price as on 8th May of 14th May contract.

The strong parentage backing and strategic shift of their production base to India presents a unique opportunity for long-term growth.

The international brokerage house is of the view that MNC companies tend to outperform the broader market over a long period as evidenced by the comparative study between the Nifty MNC index and prominent benchmarks.

“We have filtered our MNC universe of 43 stocks basis profitability ratios (ROE & ROCE) higher than 15 percent for the past three fiscal years. There are 18 stocks which fit the criteria and that include names like Blue Dart, Akzo Nobel, Abbott India, Cummins India, HUL, Castrol India, and OFSS, etc. among others,” said the note.

Why MNC?

MNC’s are professionally driven by strong corporate governance. They are known for their technological proficiency and asset-light business models.

Standard Chartered Securities India is of the view that in the post-COVID world, business models of MNCs are likely to lead the growth backed by innovation and faster adoption to changing consumer behaviour.

MNCs are usually well-capitalized with low debt exposure and good dividend policies. Most of the MNCs have market leadership in their category of operations and strong brand equity.

The report highlighted that MNCs are also likely to be key beneficiaries of structural changes such as formalisation of the Indian economy, the abolition of the Dividend Distribution Tax for corporates (as proposed in the recent budget), and India’s quest for Make-in-India to be successful.

MNC Outperformance:

Historical evidence suggests MNCs companies have delivered superior returns over a long-term period, said the note.

The MNC companies have also outperformed the broader market benchmarks over a longer period. Over a five-year period, the Nifty MNC has outperformed the Nifty50 index by 1.5 percent CAGR and the BSE 500 by 1.8 percent CAGR.

What are your views and estimates on the stock and what should investor’s do – buy, sell or hold?
Q. Moody's says India's negative rating outlook reflects a rising risk of slower GDP growth.
Investors have already factored in slower GDP growth with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on the economy.","For this week, investors should look out for Q4 FY2020 earnings and growth rate of COVID-19 cases in India and across the world, KIFS Trade Capital's Chief Strategic Officer Ritesh Asher, told Moneycontrol.","Investors have already factored in slower Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth due to the novel coronavirus pandemic and its impact on the economy, and it seems that the market has already discounted this news when hit a 52-week low, Ritesh Asher - Chief Strategic Officer (CSO) at KIFS Trade Capital, said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.

Here are edited excerpts from the interview:

Q. It looks like the markets seem to have witnessed profit-taking at higher levels. What led to the sharp sell-off on D-Street and then some recovery towards the close of the week?

A. The market witnessed a bounce back from the bottom of 7,500 largely on the back of relief measures introduced by the government.

Muted earnings season also weighed on sentiments of traders recently which lead to a sharp selloff. But speculations over various stimulus packages for stressed industries from the government has contributed to this end of the week recovery.

Q. Any factors which investors should watch out for in the coming week?

A. For the coming week, investors should look out for Q4 FY2020 earnings and growth rate of coronavirus cases in India and across the world, as it plays a crucial role in directing further economic actions.

Q. Another mega-deal in RIL’s Jio Platforms. What are your views and estimates on the stock and what should investor’s do – buy, sell or hold?

A. Reliance Industries’ Jio had a back-to-back deal in the span of less than a month from Facebook followed by Silver Lake Partners and this is the third deal in a row for by US-based company Vista Equity Partners making it the fourth largest company in India, in terms of valuation.

These deals will help RIL reduced its debt which was acting as a black spot for the reputation of the company. Reliance Industries has great potential and we recommend investors follow a buy on dips strategy and hold it if you already have it in your portfolio.

Q. Small & Midcaps outperformed in the week gone by. Looks like investors are slowly accumulating beaten down names?

A. Fundamentally, many stocks were available at favourable valuations and investors seem to have taken advantage of this opportunity. It has been observed that after front liners, the pullback was seen in the small and midcap space.

Q. Moody's says India's negative rating outlook reflects a rising risk of slower GDP growth. Do you think this is already factored in or will it weigh on markets and investor decision making?

A. Investors have already factored in slower GDP growth with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on the economy. It seems that the market had already discounted this news previously when the market made a 52-week low.

Now, market sentiments or investors' decision will depend on the future aspect of this ongoing situation based on how government and industries will take measures to overcome this negative impact.

Q. Do you think the lockdown could get extended beyond May 17? If yes, what is the kind of impact it could have on markets?

A. No, we do not think that the lockdown may get extended further for the whole country, but there might be a few states which could extend the lockdown depending on the spread.

We also do not expect things to go back to normal as it was before. The government may lift the lockdown slowly and gradually, which will act as a relief for industries that are out of business since March.

This will slowly start generating income and cash flow for drying out the economy resulting in positive impact on the market.

Q. Specialty chemicals, pharma best-placed sectors do ride out of COVID-19 storm. But, after a swift rally, are these still a good buy at current levels? What should investors do?

A. If we talk on the investment perspective, pharma is good to bet from 2017 till early 2020. The pharma sector has corrected about 45 percent, the recent recovery was around 15 percent lead by good accumulation on institutional front.

There is still a lot of space left for the sector so investors are advised to buy on dips and accumulate fundamentally sound pharma stocks for better returns.

Shree Cements continued to maintain its cost leadership in the industry with overall cost of production declining 7.3% YoY during the quarter to Rs 3095/t, which along with better pricing resulted in 34.4% YoY growth in EBITDA/t to Rs 1561/t during the quarter. However, on the revenue front, the company reported 2% YoY decline in revenues to Rs 3,218 crore (vs. I-direct estimate: Rs 3,036 crore) owing to demand weakness in the ending weeks of March 2020. Volumes for Q4FY20 dipped 5.3% YoY to 6.9 MT. Blended realisations increased 3.5% YoY to Rs 4.656/t (vs. I-direct estimate of Rs 4,780/t). Due to higher realisations and a reduction in total costs/tonne by 6% YoY, EBITDA margins expanded 772 bps YoY to 33.5% (I-direct estimate: 28.3%). Thus, EBITDA saw 27% growth YoY to Rs 1,079 crore (I-direct estimate: Rs 856 crore). Further, with proceeds from QIP being parked in liquid investments, other income is almost 2x YoY. Thus, PAT increased 83% YoY to Rs 588 crore YoY (vs. I-direct estimate of Rs 297 crore).

Outlook

Shree Cement added capacities and entered non-core regions without jeopardising its profitability and return ratios. The company has maintained leadership on the cost front led by continued focus on cost rationalisation. We expect the company to continue its leadership on the costs, profitability and, thus, return front. Thus, we maintain our positive stance on the company with a BUY rating and an unchanged target price of Rs 23,500.

Kansai Nerolac reported its Q4FY20 performance wherein revenue and earnings declined ~14% and 23% YoY, respectively. While the company’s decorative segment grew in double digits in January-February, the lockdown from the last week of March hurt overall decorative volume offtake in Q4FY20. However industrial segment (~40-45% of revenue) performance remained muted in Q4 owing to lower volume offtake from automotive industry. On the margin front, while benign raw material prices helped improve gross margins of the company (by 220 bps YoY, 100 bps QoQ) in Q4FY20, EBITDA margins stayed flat at 13% owing to lower operating leverage. Finally, higher depreciation charges, lower other income dragged PAT down 23% YoY to ~Rs 71 crore. Further, despite various challenges in FY20E, the company’s balance sheet position remained strong (with zero debt, efficient working capital management).Going ahead, while FY21E will be a challenging year for company (~45 days sales loss due to lockdown), we expect a strong recovery in FY22E led by decorative paints segment.

Outlook

KNPL is a leading paint manufacturer with a strong promoter pedigree. The company is well placed to face near term challenges of Covid-19 related slowdown due to its strong fundamentals (No. 3 decorative player with a pan-India dealer network and zero debt balance sheet). Considering a strong revival in paint demand from FY22E, we reiterate our BUY rating on the stock with a revised target price of Rs 415/share.

Nifty ended last week tad above 9,200, shedding over 6 percent as compared to the previous weekly close.

Although it appears to be a sharp cut when compared to the previous week's close, the overall trading action during the week was muted.

In fact, in the last couple of trading sessions, price action was extremely lethargic and the market completely looked directionless.

Neither bulls had the strength to overcome the sturdy wall of 9,400-9,450 nor bears were dominant enough to violate the 9,100-mark.

Hence, this week, 9,450 to 9,100 remains to be an immediate range. Only a sustainable breakout on either side would confirm the next path of action.

Traders holding existing longs should maintain their positions as long as 9,100 is successfully defended.

At present, traders are advised to stay light and should ideally continue focusing on individual stocks.

Although we are completely not out of the woods when it comes to coronavirus pandemic, we remain hopeful till the time above-mentioned key support is not violated.

Once we see Nifty surpassing the higher boundary of 9,450, we would see good broad-based participation in the market.

Here are two trading ideas for the next 3-4 weeks:

Sun Pharmaceutical Industries | Buy | LTP: Rs 470 | Target price: Rs 510 | Stop loss: Rs 447 | Upside: 8.5%

Pharma stocks are buzzing, showing signs of outperformance after a phase of slumber of more than four years.

This stock as well has shown strong outperformance and recently it has rallied from the levels of Rs 388 to Rs 500.

On the daily chart, after some correction, prices seem to have resumed the uptrend by forming a bullish candlestick.

Volume analysis indicates an increase in volume during upmove as compared to volume during correction which suggests accumulation in the stock.

Prices are well above the key averages and oscillators are positively placed supporting the buy call.

HDFC Life Insurance Company | Buy | LTP: Rs 521.65 | Target price: Rs 585 | Stop loss: Rs 487 | Upside: 12%

This stock has confirmed a bullish continuation ‘Pennant’ breakout on the daily chart.

The said breakout is supported by a good increase in volume and a bullish candlestick pattern.

On the daily chart, prices have closed above 89-EMA which was previously acting as resistance and now indicates a change in polarity.

In addition, momentum oscillator RSI, after forming a base around 50 level, has started northward journey, supporting the bullish view on this counter.

Edited excerpts:

Q) It seems markets have witnessed profit-taking at higher levels. What led to the sharp selloff on D-Street and then some recovery towards the close of the week?

A) As per statistics, Indian markets and the US have shown the highest correlation in the past month compared to the last decade. Hence, Monday was no different when Indian markets reacted in line with its global peers and witnessed crack in prices.

However, the latter half was comparatively buoyant since heavyweights such as Reliance Industries managed to keep markets afloat.

Additionally, sentiments were guided by the opening of factories in certain states, which helped recovery on D-Street towards the end of the week.

Q) Any factors that investors should watch out for in the coming week?

A) Until the lockdown ends, the situation at the ground will not be known, till then markets are expected to continue in a narrow range. Indices should take another 2-3 months to show significant cracks once again.

Markets will continue to be lackluster unless there is a fiscal stimulus announced which will indeed be accepted by the Street with open arms.

Q) Another mega deal for RIL’s Jio platform. What are your views and estimates on the stock and what should investors do?

A) Reliance Industries is playing its cards very smartly as it has single-handedly formed its own bull path. When the entire market is in a state of chaos, (Mukesh) Ambani announced three back-to-back deals along with a rights issue.

The future of Reliance Jio will depend on how effectively these deals help the platform to grow and achieve the scale it plans. However, for now, investors can hold the stock until the rights issue and dividend record date to capitalise on the gains.

A) Broader markets have substantially recovered but not all stocks would prove to be outstanding wealth-creators in the long run. A crack in the larger weights will eventually trickle down to the small and midcaps, taking them lower in times to come.

Traditionally, bear markets have lasted for a minimum of 18 months and this time isn’t expected to be different. Hence, there is still more pain left.

Investors should, therefore, patiently wait and get into sectoral leaders to prevent wealth erosion in the coming months.

Q) Moody's says India's negative rating outlook reflects a rising risk of slower GDP growth. Do you think this is factored in or will it weigh on markets and investors?

A) Markets seem to have factored in the pain, for now, given that despite the rise in daily COVID cases or negative outlook markets moved higher.

Post the lockdown, the ground-level pain will be a key data point that might lead investors to react in the markets. These reactions will be negative and ugly if the lockdown lasts longer.

Q) Do you think the lockdown will be extended beyond May 17? If yes, what will it do to the market?

A) An extension of the lockdown seems unlikely since the economy is bleeding. Currently, markets are expecting the lockdown to be lifted on May 17, however, any further extension will cause a downward movement.

Even if Mumbai and other metro cities remain in extended lockdown, the effect will be extremely negative for the economy.

Q) Specialty chemicals and pharma sectors are best placed do ride out the COVID-19 storm but, after a swift rally, are they still a good buy?

A) The pharmaceutical sector was in a long-term downtrend and faced massive pressure for the past few years. Since this is a health hazard, any positive news will take the pharma stocks zooming.

However, they can turn out to be bull traps, which we witnessed last week. Hence, investors should wait for the earnings to assess the impact of the situation on these companies.

Specialty chemicals, on the other hand, can be good from a long-term perspective since the supply from China may be shifted and Indian players are expected to gain a place in the specialty space on the world map.

However, only investors who are aggressive risk-takers should buy fundamentally stronger specialty chemical stocks.

Though current valuations are lower and they have remained so for quite sometime, only a rerating of earnings multiple will bring excellent gains in the specialty sector, which, in turn, depends on the actual bargaining power of Indian companies in the global spectrum.

RIL is back near its Rs 10 lakh crore market capitalisation (m-cap). As per its May 8 closing price, the company's m-cap stood at 9,90,088.02 crore.

All credit goes to the three back-to-back deals that took place in Jio Platforms, the 100 percent subsidiary of RIL. This is as per its deleveraging plan, or target of emerging net debt free on a net cash basis by March 2021.

On April 22, Facebook announced its decision to invest Rs 43,574 crore in Jio Platforms for a 9.99 percent stake.

Silver Lake on May 4 decided to invest Rs 5,655.75 crore for a 1.15 percent stake, at an equity value of Rs 4.90 lakh crore. On May 8, Vista Equity Partners said it would invest Rs 11,367 crore for a 2.32 percent equity stake.

Jio Platforms has now raised Rs 60,596.37 crore from leading technology investors in less than three weeks.

On April 30, RIL announced India's biggest rights issue of Rs 53,125 crore at Rs 1,257 per share.

Overall experts remain bullish on the stock given its current and expected growth in telecom as well as digital business, and its strong deleveraging plan. They feel the deal with Facebook will boost Reliance Retail's business and help RIL grow much faster in coming years.

Umesh Mehta, Head of Research, Samco Securities, advises investors to hold the stock till the rights issue and dividend record date to capitalise on the gains.

Last week, RIL informed the exchanges it expects to complete the capital raising programme totalling over Rs 1.04 lakh crore by Q1 FY21. ""This includes investment by Facebook in Jio Platforms, the upcoming rights issue and the previous investment by British Petroleum in FY20.""

Indian markets have joined global peers in a massive equity sell-off led by fears of a sudden and swift economic slowdown, given the novel coronavirus pandemic.

We have deployed enormous humanitarian and economic efforts to manage and recover from one of the biggest health crisis of our time.

From an investor’s perspective, the sharp fall offers an opportunity to have an equity exposure from a medium to long-term perspective. Historically, markets have always behaved extreme in the short run to any adverse developments led by aggressive investor reactions.

Only when the dust settles, and sanity returns, the prices tend to re-adjust to the new economic realities. In 2008, while the market corrected by 60 percent from its January high, the Nifty EPS for CY2009 was only about 20 percent lower than CY2007.

What followed in CY2009 was a strong 75 percent rally in the Nifty.

Likewise, positioning portfolios accordingly to take advantage of any mispricing and possible recovery, is going to be a key call for any investor today.

Like in cricket, playing the right players for the right pitch is most important, so is choosing the right market segment to take advantage of a comeback.

A realistic assessment of the current situation points to only a gradual recovery after a weaker near-term moderation in growth.

In this context, the large-cap segment of the market seems to be the best positioned to limit drawdowns and recover earlier as normalcy returns.

This is primarily driven by its ability to navigate the near-term cyclical slowdown and at the same time be resilient enough when things improve.

In the year 2008, the Nifty made a bottom in October, quite ahead of BSE Mid Small cap index which made a bottom only in March 2009.

Thereafter, equity markets witnessed a strong rally in April 2009 and the Nifty returned 37 percent in six months from its October lows. The recovery in the BSE Mid Small cap index was however much lower at 22 percent.

Similarly, in CY2011, Nifty contained its worst drawdown to 24 percent versus 36 percent for the S&P BSE Mid Small cap index. This reflects well about the ability of large caps to limit the drawdowns and stage a quicker comeback as well.

After the steep fall from the recent highs in January this year, valuation in the large-cap space has become favourable after a long time.

The 40 percent fall in the Nifty from its January highs to the March lows, took its one year forward P/E to a level close to 11x.

These are the similar valuation levels that acted as the market bottom in the three significant market declines in the past 15 years, except the global financial crisis of 2008, where the market bottomed at about 8x one year forward P/E.

It would also be wise to do a similar analysis based on trailing earnings. Nifty trailing P/E hit a low of 14.7x in March, which is roughly one standard deviation below its 20-year average. Similarly, on a P/B basis, the valuations are closer to its 18-year low.

Going deeper into Nifty constituents, we see that 88 percent of the Nifty stocks are trading below their 10-year average valuations on one-year forward earnings. Of these, roughly 65 percent of the stocks are below their one standard deviation.

Generally, investments at such valuation levels in the past have yielded high teens annualized returns on a two-year horizon. While timing the market bottom has been a holy grail forever, we believe these are attractive valuation levels from a risk-reward framework.

Historically, sector-leading companies are found to be more resilient when in a recovery stage, and hence increasing equity allocation here would be a wiser decision at this juncture.

Lastly, for investors, in such times, it is far more important how we behave rather than how our investments behave.

Not reacting to panic, sticking to asset allocation, timely rebalancing, and positioning portfolios in companies with sustainable competitive advantage would go a long way in minimizing the damage and using volatility to our benefit.

Note: Mutual fund investments are subject to market risks, read all scheme related documents carefully.

“Along with growth shock, there is another challenge for Small and Midcaps equity. Credits are getting re-priced in this environment and it will also impact these companies’ ability to get funding,” Sameer Kaul, MD and CEO, TrustPlutus Wealth Managers (India) Pvt. Ltd told Moneycontrol.

“Unavailability of credit and uncertain growth environment will create too much risk for investment at this point in time. Hence, we suggest being cautious before investing in the Mid and Small-cap businesses,” he said.

Irrespective of the market cap of the company, investors should focus on key monitorable such as management pedigree, growth potential, uniqueness of the product, as well as operational efficiencies.

“One should be cautious in all caps I would say, as now only the most resilient will survive the onslaught of the undergoing economic crisis.

“And even large caps resting on their past laurels could get hit. But true, one should do a thorough and in-depth analysis before investing in small and midcaps.

Yes, 2020 has been a treacherous year, so far, for most investment portfolios. And yes, external factors that were beyond your control are mainly to blame.

But, what if we were to tell you that there was something you could have done better too. Don't fret. They say it's okay to make mistakes as long as you learn from them.

And turns out that the biggest financial lesson from the current crisis is also the simplest: always diversify your investments.

Here's why.

If you had an all-equity portfolio worth Rs 1,00,000 at the start of 2020, you're probably down a painful 28 percent to Rs 72,000 as of March-end, which means you'll need a whopping 39 percent gain to recover from the recent carnage.

And based on how unpredictable and bearish things are at the moment, you'd agree that those kinds of spectacular gains are far out in the future.

On the flip side, if your portfolio at the start of 2020 was divided between equities, debt and gold in 40:40:20 ratio, the current value would be 92k, requiring a much lower 8.7 percent gain to be whole again.

Pretty good, right? (Here, equity represents Sensex returns, debt represents 10-year G-sec return, gold represents domestic gold spot price returns as on March 31, 2020).

So, how exactly does this diversification work?

Let's take a day-to- day example. Have you ever noticed that street vendors often sell seemingly unrelated products-- umbrellas and sunglasses? Initially, that may seem odd. After all, when will someone buy both the items at the same time?

Probably never--and that's the point. Vendors know that when it rains, it's easier to sell umbrellas but harder to sell sunglasses and when it's sunny, the reverse is true.

By selling both items- in other words, by diversifying the product line--the vendor can reduce the risk of losing money on any given day. If that makes sense, you've got a great start on understanding asset allocation and diversification.

Unfortunately, unlike the vendor, who knows that monsoons follow summer and summer follows monsoons, investors don't deal with predictable economic cycles.

Economies go through ups and downs and these more often than not are unforeseeable.

Assets in our portfolio, due to their differing risk and return characteristics, respond differently to these ups and downs. You'd agree that equities run-up when the economy is doing well and gold tends to shine when the economy is down.

In essence, because it is difficult to predict the future of the economy, it is also difficult to determine the best-performing asset class. That's where asset allocation and diversification come in handy.

Asset allocation is a time-tested approach to portfolio management. It means spreading your investments among multiple asset classes such as stocks and bonds.

By including asset categories with investment returns that move up and down differently under different market conditions within a portfolio, an investor can limit significant losses.

Market conditions that cause one asset category to do well, often cause another asset category to have average or poor returns. By investing in more than one asset category, you'll reduce the risk of losing money and your portfolio's overall investment returns will have a smoother ride.

If one asset category's investment return falls, you'll be in a position to counteract your losses in that asset category with better returns in another asset category.

The concluding point is that diversification, whilst offering no guarantees of portfolio performance or complete protection against risk, increases the possibility of an investor's portfolio withstanding the elements in a financial atmosphere experiencing both man-made and natural disasters on an almost daily basis.

We did some number crunching to substantiate our point.

Rallis India's results were disappointing due to lost sales from COVID (RS 692 mn), forex loss (Rs 99 mn) and other one-off items. Impact on the international business was more than domestic. Lockdown has impacted the operations but there is gradual improvement every passing day in limping back to normalcy.

Despite weak results and near term blip in business due to COVID, outlook on Rallis remains robust.

Most analysts remain bearish on the stock on account of the coronavirus outbreak hitting business.

The stock, which has fallen more than 80 percent in the last one year, was quoting at Rs 120.70, down 6.36 percent on the BSE at 1358 hours.

Despite the sharp correction, HDFC Securities maintained its reduce rating with a target of Rs 136, given elevated risks and sub-par expected return ratios.

""RBL Bank's Q4 earnings were higher versus estimates on account of sharper-than-expected margin expansion (not sustainable) and lower than expected loan loss provisions (elevated nevertheless, to persist), but balance sheet growth was constrained as deposits dipped 8 percent QoQ (1 percent YoY). RBL faces challenges on both sides of the balance sheet -- potential stress from high unsecured loan exposure and a weak deposit franchise,"" the brokerage said.

The private sector lender reported a 53.7 percent year-on-year (YoY) decline in standalone profit at Rs 114.36 crore due to 207.1 percent jump in provisions.

Net interest income grew by 38.2 percent to Rs 1,020.98 crore YoY with advances book growth at 7 percent YoY (down 3 percent QoQ), but total deposits reduced 1 percent YoY (down 8 percent QoQ).

Asset quality also weakened with gross non-performing assets (NPA) as a percentage of gross advances rising 29 basis points QoQ to 3.62 percent, but net NPA declined 2 basis points QoQ to 2.05 percent as of March 2020.

""Gross NPLs increases by 30 bps, with slippages staying elevated at annualised 5 percent (corporate book clean-up and portfolio mix change).

Credit cost was high at annualised 4.2 percent, also driven by accelerated provision on recognized corporate stress (PCR up 600 bps) and Rs 115 crore COVID-related (included full 10 percent provisions on standard-but-overdue accounts, 100 percent provisions on cards NPLs and contingent provisions on retail portfolio),” said Yes Securities.

It said asset quality risks include 33 percent of portfolio opting for moratorium till April 30; BB & Below at 6.5 percent (few lumpy exposures); BBB rated portfolio at 20 percent and 7.5 percent BBB & BB rated exposure to COVID-hit sectors.

While retaining reduce call with a target price of Rs 135, the brokerage said it cut FY21/22 earnings estimates by 88/44 percent due to sharp adverse adjustments to loan growth, fee growth and credit cost.

Key FY21 expectations of the bank are: a) cautious on growth; cards and MFI drivers in second half of FY21, b) NIMs to witness some compression due to surplus liquidity and interest reversals, c) credit cost similar or mildly higher than FY20 (3.6 percent).

""Given its portfolio complexion, the bank faces heightened near-term macro uncertainty, which will keep a check on valuation. Asset quality and growth trends in Cards, MFI and LAP segments critical to valuation,"" said Yes Securities.

Emkay believes RBL's expected business/return on assets (RoA) normalisation from FY21 could be pushed back due to COVID-19-led disruption. Hence, the brokerage retained hold rating with a target price of Rs 145 due to lower valuations and timely shoring up of capital (Tier I over 15 percent) but retained underweight rating in its Emkay Alpha Portfolio.

Motilal Oswal said the asset quality would continue to remain under pressure, with concerns over retail as the COVID-19 outbreak would impact delinquency trends in the portfolios of credit cards/MFI and MSME.

""Around 33 percent of the loan portfolio availed moratorium; thus, we expect credit cost trends to remain elevated at 3.6 percent for FY21.

Furthermore, the bank's BBB-/BB-rated exposures to COVID-19-impacted sectors stood at 5.6/1.8 percent. This may pose a risk as the business environment remains weak, thus prolonging the slippage trend in the Wholesale portfolio,"" it said.

The brokerage cut its PAT estimate for FY21/FY22 by 6/5 percent, as it factored in moderation in fee income led by reduced economic activity and lockdown but maintained a buy call with a target of Rs 180 per share.

RSI stands for Relative Strength Index. It is a momentum oscillator used to identify trend reversal.

RSI was invented by Welles Wilder Jr. The default look-back period for RSI is 14, however, this can be lowered to increase sensitivity or raised to decrease sensitivity. RSI calculates strength of a stock's trend and helps to predict their reversals.

Why to buy Tata Motors?

There are a lot of trading strategies using RSI; below mentioned is one of the most popular among trading community which involves Buy after completing retracement for higher movement.

In the past few days, RSI had given a breakout by moving above 50 levels from below and then it made a high of 80 then after that it is moving lower or retracing towards the centre line placed at 50 level, this behavior is called as ‘RSI PBB’ setup.

RSI PBB is Pull Back Buy setup which indicates, once RSI turns its tail upside after taking support from zone of 45-55 levels, target is previous swing high of RSI which was 80 or previous swing high of prices (Rs 94).

Currently, Tata Motors is going through this setup and we expect higher price movement towards previous high Rs 94-98 levels in coming days.

1. Recent RSI gave a breakout and reached swing top around 80 levels.2. After marking high of 80, RSI is retracing towards 50 towards mid-line standing around 50 mark.3.

5. Decent volume participation while forming a bullish candle will also give additional confirmation.

Profit Booking:

Whenever price candle will be near previous swing high which is near Rs 94-98 levels.

Stop Loss:

Entire bullish view negates on breaching of a swing low and one should exit from long position.

Conclusion:

We recommend buying Tata Motors around Rs 81-80 levels with a stop loss of Rs 73 on a closing basis for higher targets of Rs 94 and Rs 98 levels as indicated in above chart.

Input costs and benign and provide a lever to MRCO to reduce prices and gain share from unorganized players.

A strong demand environment and a depreciating currency have put the pharma sector in a sweet spot.

Some brokerages and market experts believe COVID-19 will bring about a change in market leadership and pharma will emerge stronger.

""After almost 4 years of underperformance, pharma seems to have regained its lost 'mojo' in the last 2 months as focus globally turns towards this sector. We think Indian pharma stocks will be the leaders of the next bull run for the next 2/3 years as earnings, volumes & growth will see outperform. Also, the need for medicine stocking may be more psychological which could drive higher volumes both globally & locally,"" Sanjiv Bhasin, Director at IIFL, said in an interview with Moneycontrol.

Brokerage firm Axis Capital points out tailwinds emerging in the US generic business.

""With tailwinds emerging in US generics after COVID-19, we expect negative operating leverage (high CAPEX and R&D coupled with slower approvals/ USFDA issues) which had compressed return ratios to improve over near to medium term,"" said Axis Capital.

The brokerage has raised EPS and PE for US-focused companies.

On the other hand, despite near-term challenges, domestic-focused companies’ growth is seen steady over the medium-term.

Axis Capital continues to like domestic-focused companies for sustainable growth and margin and the ability to generate free cash flows.

Axis has a buy recommendation on Aurobindo, Cadila, Biocon, Alembic, Eris Lifesciences and Natco Pharma.

On the earnings front, brokerages expect the domestic formulations segment to see a healthy Q4 with 9-12 percent year-on-year (YoY) organic growth for the sector, with the limited impact of COVID-19 on domestic sales for the quarter, given most companies have a cut-off date of around March 20 for book sales.

HDFC Securities downgraded its rating to reduce.

The stock lost 58 percent of its value in last three months. It was quoting at Rs 208.55, down 9.99 percent on the BSE at 14:33 hours IST.

HDFC Securities downgraded its rating on Cyient to reduce from add post a weak performance and bleak growth outlook.

""Services growth and margin performance in Q4 were disappointing. Growth in the first half of FY21 will be severely impacted due to a structural problem in A&D and supply-side (COVID-related) issues in Communication and Transportation verticals. Cyient's higher mix of mechanical services and elevated exposure to stressed verticals has magnified the COVID-19 impact versus its peers,"" the brokerage said.

It has reduced its EPS estimates by 16.4/13.8 percent for FY21/22. Its price target on the stock stood Rs 240, based on 9x FY22E EPS, which is at around 30 percent discount to 5-year average 1-year-forward P/E multiple.

Cyient's revenue stood at $149.2 million, down 3.9/9.7 percent QoQ/YoY against HDFC Securities' estimates of $153 million, while constant currency revenue degrowth was 3.7 percent QoQ.

Its revenue was down 4 percent YoY in constant currency (CC) terms versus growth of 12.8/1.8 percent YoY CC growth for HCL/Wipro ER&D division.

Management has indicated of a steep fall of around 15-20 percent QoQ in Q1FY21.

EBIT margin contracted 118 bps QoQ to 8.4 percent (lowest ever). Services margin stood at 9.6 percent down 100bps QoQ.

""The margin recovery will be linked to growth and Q4FY21 exit will be similar to Q4FY20. Cyient’s higher mix of mechanical engineering (legacy) services explains the poor growth metrics and the lower margin structure compared to ER&D peers,"" said HDFC Securities.

The brokerage further said Cyient was struggling with issues such as (1) stress in services portfolio, (2) stress in top accounts (3) Issues in core vertical (aerospace and defence), (4) focus on lower margin DLM business and (5) lower margins structure due to investments and muted growth.

""Concerns related to slowdown in decision making, COVID-19 related uncertainty and higher mix of legacy services remain,"" it added.

HDFC Securities expects USD revenue growth of down 20/up 7.8 percent and EBIT percent of 7.8/8.8 percent for FY21/22.

Motilal Oswal also feels Cyient's Q4FY20 revenue and adjusted EBIT margins were disappointing. The brokerage has a neutral call on the stock.

""Sharper disruption versus peers (e.g. HCL Tech's ER&D portfolio) is also a reflection of the company's weak execution capabilities. We anticipate a material slowdown in key verticals like A&D, Transportation and E&U (contributing around 60 percent of revenue) over the next 12-18 months,"" it said.

""While Communications (around 23 percent of revenue) may not be heavily impacted by COVID-19, the liquidity crunch would mean low emphasis on ER&D spends. Supply-side issues in ER&D are more pronounced than in IT services given the reluctance of clients to enable Work from Home (WFH) due to concerns around plagiarism/IP theft,"" it added.

Hence, the brokerage cut its EPS estimates for FY20-22 by 31-33 percent due to the worse-than-expected results and commentary.

""Given the continued execution challenges at the company, dented visibility on earnings recovery and the one-off trail, hope of a re-rating may be too optimistic. Target price of Rs 260 is based on around 10x FY22E EPS,"" Motilal Oswal said.

24,"May 10, 2020 10:15 AM IST",Kshitij Anand,Here’s an ideal portfolio construction strategy for every mother,"However, I firmly believe that the portfolio shared below can help every mother tide the current financial crisis, with better management of household income.

Additionally, SIPs help you better navigate through market volatility, offering a pause option to be exercised, should the need arise.
Debt mutual funds, on the other hand, prevent erosion in corpus due to market volatility.","This Mother’s Day, we can urge every mother, working or non-working, to arm herself with financial knowledge, requisite to make sound investment decisions.","Rahul Jain

At a time when stock markets have nosedived, production has come to a grinding halt and being confined within four walls of our homes has became the new normal, one thing that remains constant is mother’s love and care for her family.

Women around the world, continue to work and care for their families, just as they always have, for centuries.

Mothers are considered as the epitome of nurturing and usually juggle various roles in their life, managing each of them with ease and elan. Their selfless contribution to our well-being and prosperity, cannot be recompensed.

Tough balancing act

Balancing household budgets with income, managing expenses and every expectation is a daunting task. Exercising utmost precision and prudence to stretch finances just a wee bit more, a mother’s knack has been legendary. And in the current situation, it is a worthy challenge for a superhero.

Adding to the mix, are possible pay cuts and job losses, school fees, and EMIs, not to mention day-to-day expenses and four square, healthy meals for her family, every single day.

The prayer on every mother’s lips today is to find the right solution that allows her to balance the needs and wants of her family, without compromise and with as much relative ease as she can muster.

However, I firmly believe that the portfolio shared below can help every mother tide the current financial crisis, with better management of household income.

With this in her arsenal, she can meet essential expenses, save considerably despite limited resources and also address her own priorities, with ease.

Structure of the portfolio

Dedicated and disciplined investments in different asset classes such as equity mutual funds, unit-linked insurance plans (ULIPs) and debt mutual funds, can help every mother address two crucial needs — her children’s education and the well-being of her family.

To give you a simple example, assuming you are 35-years-old with a child aged five, you would need over Rs 40 lakh, for his/her graduation.

This is assuming that the cost of graduation is approximately Rs 15 lakh, today. This would, with an annual rate of inflation of 10 percent, escalate to Rs 43 lakh, 11 years down the line.

In order to achieve this, you would need to consistently set aside a monthly investment of Rs 18,000 for 11 years, to generate an annual return of 10 percent.

You can easily achieve this by investing in a systematic investment plan (SIP) investing in equity mutual funds and in unit-linked insurance plans (ULIPs), offering annualised returns of 12 percent.

This would amount to Rs 12,600 per month, which when coupled with a monthly investment of Rs 5,400 in a debt fund offering 6 percent per annum for 11 years, can help build the above corpus.

SIPs in equity mutual funds infuse much-needed discipline into your investments and ULIPs offer investment and protection, within a single product.

Additionally, SIPs help you better navigate through market volatility, offering a pause option to be exercised, should the need arise.

In times like now, this option to pause your SIPs can come in handy. This option helps you take a brief break from your SIP payments and also allows you to restart them later, without the need for an exit given lack of funds. Debt mutual funds, on the other hand, prevent erosion in corpus due to market volatility.

ULIPs offer partial withdrawal facility after a mandatory lock-in period of five years, which comes handy to ride any liquidity crunch, especially amidst black swan events like the one we are currently witnessing.

In case of any untoward incident, the life cover kicks in, and the proceeds can help your family tide over your absence, without any financial stress

Companies that produce hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug, and other pharma firms have done well over the last two months. There is expected to be a huge demand for the pharma sector in the coming years, analysts say.

""Earnings momentum will continue in pharma space. We prefer a stock-specific approach after the broad-based rally,"" said CLSA, which raised earnings estimates for the sector by 5-7 percent for FY21-22.

The Nifty Pharma index gained half a percent on May 6, taking total gains to around 45 percent since March 23.

Indian pharma stocks would lead the bull run for the next two to three years as earnings, volumes and growth will rise. ""Also the need for medicine stocking may be more psychological which could drive higher volumes both globally and locally,"" he said.

Jefferies expects Sun Pharma to report 21 percent earnings CAGR over FY20-22 against 14 percent for Dr Reddy's Labs.

The investing phenomenon is dynamic in nature and usually changes over a period of time based on the prevailing trend.,"Berkshire Hathaway confirmed that in April it sold its “entire positions” in the four largest carriers - American Airlines Group Inc, Delta Air Lines Inc, Southwest Airlines Co, and United Airlines Holdings Inc, Warren Buffett told investors last weekend.

The legendary investor sold his stake in the ""big four"" US airlines at a loss in April, going against his own advice. But, it does suggest that investors should not wait, and cut losses at the earliest.

Warren Buffett exited the positions after the coronavirus pandemic which could alter the way airlines function once the lockdown opens. Buffett said he “made a mistake” investing in the sector, which the pandemic has changed “in a very major way” with no fault of the airlines.

Warren Buffett once again showed investors as to how one can cut losses and preserve cash, and one should just build a portfolio based on the investment climate. The investing phenomenon is dynamic in nature and usually changes over a period of time based on prevailing trends, suggest experts.

“There are few cyclical sectors which see ups and downs over the course of the business cycle, and to capitalize from their undervaluation it is imperative to catch the bottom which is technically difficult,” Dinesh Rohira is a Founder & CEO of 5nance.com told Moneycontrol.

“Nevertheless, the long term investor can still capitalize from such valuation gaps of quality names through a staggered investment approach at different price levels and stick to the core fundamentals of investing. The challenges in the economy are likely to persist for an extended period due to the current pandemic which might remain even for 1 or 2 years from now,” he said.

What to buy:

Warren Buffett, a former student of Benjamin Graham, is noted as a legendary value investor. He emphasizes on stocks that are trading at reasonable prices.

Making the job simpler for investors in picking stocks conforming to the values of Buffett, we have taken data from MarketSmith powered by William O'Neil.

The following stocks were filtered with the highest Master Score and RS (Relative Strength) rating. Master Score is a proprietary filter created by MarketSmith that highlights great earnings potential and strong price performance of a stock.

On the other hand, RS rating is a technical tool that is the most popular way to see the market’s top performers. The Relative Strength rating is the result of calculating a stock’s percentage price change over the last 12 months.

A 40 percent weight is assigned to the latest three-month period; the remaining three quarters each receive 20 percent weight. All stocks are arranged in order of greatest price percentage change and assigned a percentile rank from 99 (highest) to 1 (lowest).

The filter is applied to look for companies with long-term past and potential future growth. Of the stocks returned by the screen, Buffett most likely would emphasize on those trading at reasonable prices.

The stocks having a market capitalisation greater than Rs 500 crore and Average Rupee Volume greater than 10,000 crores are considered to filter stocks for the list.

Here are 10 stocks according to the above-mentioned parameters that one should look at (they are filtered based on Market Score). The stocks having market capitalization greater than Rs 500 crore and Average Rupee Volume greater than 10,000 crores are considered to filter stocks for the list:

Abbott India: Master Score 85

While some sectors of the economy may see some relief after the lockdown ends, there are some, such as capital goods and consumer durables, that may have to wait for a longer time to see normalcy returning.

Brokerages point out that the capital goods sector has seen lower order inflow in the last couple of quarters especially from the private sector due to factors, including overcapacity and land acquisition issues.

In the aftermath of the slowdown in the investment cycle for the last few years, COVID-19 is likely to prove to be the last nail in the coffin for the sector.

For the consumer durable companies, Q4FY20 started on a strong note with strong volume growth in January and February 2020. However, their volume was affected towards the end of March owing to the COVID-led nationwide lockdown.

""The companies which were experiencing supply-side issues from China during January-February 2020 period, now face demand issues across product categories,"" said Arafat Saiyed, Assistant Vice President at Reliance Securities.

COVID-19 is expected to have a significant impact on the capex cycle, which has already been muted for the last couple of years.

""The government's priority now is providing the basic necessities for survival, while capex and infrastructure development will be delayed by at least 6-9 months. The companies having a healthy balance sheet, strong cash and long-term scalability throughout disruptions will pass this phase rather easily,"" said Saiyed.

Here are 5 stocks from the above two sectors that, as per brokerages, look attractive for a long-term perspective. Take a look:

Analyst: Arafat Saiyed, Assistant Vice President at Reliance Securities

KEC International | Buy | LTP: Rs 208.60 | Target price: Rs 328 | Upside: 57%

Shares of KEC international have corrected about 45 percent in the last 2 months owing to COVID-led disruptions, which, as per the analyst, offers a fresh buying opportunity, as the company has already received approvals from the respective authorities to start operations at a few of its sites albeit in a phased manner.

The current order book stands at Rs 2,1000 crore, while order inflow for FY20 is seen at Rs 11,000 crore (down 22 percent YoY).

Domestic orders contribute 62 percent to the order book, while international projects account for about 38 percent.

As per the analyst, the management has guided that the revenue is expected to decline marginally (Rs 300 crore) in Q4FY20.

Larsen & Toubro | Buy | LTP: Rs 839 | Target price: Rs 1,670 | Upside: 99%

The analyst expects Larsen & Toubro to report an order inflow of Rs 66,000 crore in Q4FY20 as the company has already announced orders worth about Rs 50,000 crore to the exchanges.

For FY20, the company has guided for order inflow growth of 10-12 percent.

""We continue to view Larsen & Toubro as a proxy play of CAPEX revival in India considering a huge opportunity, proven execution track record and strong diversification,"" said the analyst.

Crompton greaves Consumer | Buy | LTP: Rs 208 | Target price: Rs 344 | Upside: 65%

Crompton has a relatively low share of seasonal products and healthy cash balance which enables the company to stay strong in the downturn.

The analyst expects Crompton’s competitive positioning to remain strong with new entrants facing pricing and working-capital challenges.

""COVID-19 will impact Q4FY20 and Q1FY21 performance. The strong balance sheet will help tide over the lockdown period with support to vendors and channels. With continued strong demand for new launches, market leadership and robust distribution network, we expect Crompton’s earnings to clock 16 percent CAGR through FY19-22E,"" said the analyst.

Brokerage: Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers

Dixon Technologies | Buy | LTP: Rs 4,409.70 | Target price: Rs 5,392 | Upside: 22%

The brokerage highlights that the company is well placed to cater to mounting demand across multiple categories in the rapidly growing Indian consumer durables sector.

""Dixon’s scale and size give it an edge. With robust aspirational demand in India, customs-duty structures being inverted to support Make-in-India, and GST rates rationalised, Dixon’s growth seems to be aligned with strategic steps. Further reduction in GST rates would eventually result in deeper penetration,"" said the brokerage.

With manufacturing operations in India ramping up, established domestic and global brands in India are looking at lowering imports in a phased manner. This would help in adding clients and ramping up volumes in existing and forthcoming product categories.

""We model 24 percent and 32 percent CAGR over FY20-22 in respectively revenue and PAT, resulting in the RoCE expanding from 26 percent in FY19 to about 36 percent in FY21 and FY22,"" said the brokerage.

Amber Enterprises | Buy | LTP: Rs 1,124 | Target price: Rs 1,437 | Upside: 28%

As per the brokerage, Amber has gradually emerged as a contract manufacturer for domestic room ACs. It is set to emerge stronger after COVID-19 as rising financial pressure on OEMs might compel them to increase the outsourcing of components as well as fully-assembled ACs.

Its customers now include most OEMs, domestic and MNCs, as well as white-label brands of leading e-commerce portals and chain stores, courtesy its service portfolio capable of providing end-to-end solutions. This, its key strength should help it emerge stronger after this black-swan event, said the brokerage.

""Anticipating shrinking demand from OEMs, we lower our FY20e PAT 4 percent, and about 18 percent for FY21 and FY22. We now model consolidated revenue/PAT CAGRs of 15 percent/18 percent over FY20-22, resulting in the RoCE expanding from 19 percent to 20 percent,"" said the brokerage.

The brokerage believes Amber is well placed to emerge stronger from this unprecedented event, considering that its contract manufacturing abilities would be further strengthened by rising deemed exports in FY21 and FY22.

Persistent Systems: Persistent Systems promoters increased have their stake in the company to 31.91 percent from 30.47 in the previous year. The stock has given 8.49 percent return YTD (Image Source: Moneycontrol)

Persistent Systems share price gained 5 percent on May 7 as most brokerages retained their buy rating on the stock given the steady growth in Q4FY20 and reasonable valuation after recent fall.

The stock fell 36.5 percent from its January peak till March 23. It is still down around 29 percent from its January highs. It closed at Rs 531.50, up 5.34 percent, on the BSE on May 7.

""We retain our buy rating on Persistent Systems with a revised price target of Rs 650 (potential upside of 28.7 percent), given its reasonable valuation,"" Sharekhan said.

Cash and cash equivalents account for 38 percent of its current market capitalisation; reasonable valuation and high cash and cash equivalents are expected to provide downside support to the stock price, according to the brokerage house.

While maintaining buy call with a target at Rs 730 (the highest among brokerages, potential upside of 45 percent), Motilal Oswal also feels despite the disruption due to COVID-19, Persistent's strong performance within the services segment (around 15/11 percent in 4Q/FY20, YoY) reflected its steady progress on turnaround.

""As the pandemic situation is expected to increase the uptake of digital services, we expect Persistent's portfolio to benefit. High exposure to salesforce consulting and verticals such as Technology, Healthcare, and BFSI gives us this confidence,"" the brokerage said.

The company’s robust performance in 4Q (barring IP), healthy deal pipeline, and cautiously optimistic outlook indicate the near-term COVID-19 disruption would not be as bad as we initially anticipated, it added.

Persistent Systems delivered a steady performance in a tough environment, with better-than-expected performance in both revenue and operating profitability. USD revenue came at $127.1 million, down by 1.8 percent QoQ, attributed to significant 24.3 percent QoQ decline in IP-led revenue due to weak seasonality and lower revenue re-seller business because of COVID-19 outbreak. PAT declined 4.7 percent QoQ mainly due to lower forex gain.

However, the sharp decline in IP revenue was partially offset by 3.8 percent QoQ growth in Technology Services Unit (TSU, 73.7 percent of total revenue), driven by strong 7 percent QoQ growth in digital revenue.

""IP revenue should continue to be an overhang. Historically, execution challenges and volatility in the IP portfolio have led to inconsistency in the company’s performance. However, the recent improvement witnessed in execution and a higher focus on annuity revenue should address this issue to some extent,"" said Motilal Oswal.

The brokerage upgraded its EPS estimates over FY20–22 by 20–22 percent. ""While material delay in clients’ discretionary spends is a monitorable risk, subdued multiples offer adequate margin for safety,"" it said.

EBITDA margin improved by 41 bps QoQ to 13.8 percent despite lower IP revenue and bad provisions in the wake of COVID-19, led by lower sales and marketing expenses, decline in purchase/royalty expenses, and rupee benefits (50 bps).

Management expects margin to improve in FY21 on account of lower sales and marketing expenses and completion of rebranding activities.

""We assume FY21 is going to be a weak year, given anticipated material deterioration in the demand environment. However, growth is likely to recover in FY22 once the situation normalises,"" Sharekhan said.

Meanwhile, Persistent expanded its partnership with Dassault Systèmes to strengthen digital transformation capabilities in Europe.

""This agreement brings industrial OEMs and suppliers to the Dassault Systèmes 3DEXPERIENCE platform where clients can reduce costs, improve supplier collaboration, drive agility and gather better field insights for future product iterations and customer support,"" company said in its BSE filing.

ICICI Direct

In a post COVID-19 world, we expect digital technologies to gain traction. Persistent is expected to be a key beneficiary of this digital acceleration. In addition, the focus of the new management on large annuity oriented deals, increase in deal sizes and less reliance on top client bodes well for services growth in the long term (which is also visible in the near term quarterly performance).

In addition, the company also has substantial cash on its balance sheet (around 24 percent of market cap), which can be used for acquisition (to fuel growth). Further, considering multiple levers for cost rationalisation, we expect margins to see an improved trajectory in the long term. This, coupled with reasonable valuation of 10x P/E on FY22 EPS, prompts us to remain optimistic on the stock. Hence, we maintain buy rating on the stock with a revised target price of Rs 625 per share (potential upside of 23.8 percent).

Anand Rathi

Taking into account potential weakness in contract renewals and smaller accounts, we cut FY21 and FY22 respectively around 12 percent and 7 percent. However, we believe that current valuations factor in the risks and, on free cash flow basis, the stock can generate 14 percent yield. Maintain buy with target of Rs 630 (potential upside of 24.8 percent).

Centrum Broking

We believe Persistent delivering steady growth in Enterprise segment could enable address larger opportunity as well as stabilize performance. Post Q4FY20, we model Persistent Systems USD revenue growth/(decline) at (3.8)/8.7 percent for FY21/FY22 (versus (2)/8.5 percent modelled earlier).

We trim EPS estimates by 9/4 percent for FY21/FY22E led revenue, margin downgrade. Stock trades at 9.6x FY22E EPS and valuations are reasonable. We reduce our target price by 4 percent to Rs 650 (potential upside 28.7 percent). Retain buy.

Emkay

The company’s senior leadership has taken 20-25 percent salary cuts as a temporary measure to protect margins. We note that cash generation improved in the March 2020 quarter after the weakness in 9MFY20 on account of changes in the internal finance systems.

We raise FY21/22 estimates by 5/2 percent on higher-margin assumptions but retain revenue estimates broadly. We introduce FY23 EPS at around Rs 60. We maintain hold, with a revised target price of Rs 550 (versus Rs 540 earlier) based on an unchanged 10x FY22E EPS.

There is a very popular saying on Dalal Street - Sell in May and go away. But the question for now is - are the price patterns reflecting this trend?

The phrase has not always proved to be correct but May and October are the two significant months as far as the time cycle of the market is concerned.

If one axis of the chart in technical analysis studies the information regarding price, the other one deals with the time which is often ignored.

As per the time cycle, the month of May has seen major movements in the market but was not always on the downside.

We witnessed two upper freezes in the year 2,009. To be precise, the major moves that were registered as per the time cycle have taken place between 16th and 20th May (most of the time) and traders need to be cautious to avoid damages.

Looking at the current scenario, we can say that Nifty is trading in a short-term range of 9,380 to 8,900, and considering the time cycle, we could see major moves in the coming days if Nifty trades on either side of the above-mentioned levels.

Levels of 10,000 can be witnessed in the current month in case of higher range trades. On the flip side, 8,000 can be seen quite easily if 8,900 gets traded on a closing basis.

As of now, wait and watch policy needs to be adopted. Let prices and time cycle decide the next leg of the market.

Apart from this, certain buying opportunities exist and could fetch 7 to 10 percent returns in the short term.

Here are three buy calls for the next 3-4 weeks:

Bharti Airtel | Buy | LTP: Rs 528 | Target price: Rs 580 | Stop loss: Rs 500 | Upside: 10%

Bulls are having an upper hand as the bullish cup and handle formation has been witnessed in the counter.

The weekly chart is trading with higher top and higher bottom formation and bullish breakout on the daily chart indicating that the next leg of the up move is on the cards.

RSI is in a bullish zone after two months of consolidation and other momentum indicators are also supporting the bullish bias.

Long positions can be initiated in the stock at Rs 527 and on any dips till Rs 510 for short-term gains.

Indraprastha Gas | Buy | LTP: Rs 468.50 | Target price: Rs 500 | Stop loss: Rs 445 | Upside: 7%

Bullish momentum is building up in the counter and positive crossover of major short term and medium term moving averages has been witnessed on the daily chart.

Momentum indicators are on the verge of breaking out and could result in a decent rally in the short term.

United Spirits | Buy | LTP: Rs 504 | Target price: Rs 545 | Stop loss: Rs 478 | Upside: 8%

After a decent correction from higher levels, the stock has formed a bullish “Doji” candlestick pattern at the support levels.

Range shift in RSI has been witnessed on a daily chart from the bearish zone to the sideways zone indicating that phase of downside has abated and a new trend could emerge from the current levels.

The stock is placed at a decent risk-reward level and offering lucrative buying opportunity from the short term perspective

Persistent reported 1.8% QoQ decline in revenues as US$127mn (in line with our estimates) as Alliance Business de-grew 28% QoQ, partially off-set by 3.8% QoQ growth in Services (Technology+ Digital) Segment. OPM for the quarter improved 50bps QoQ to 9.2% (our estimate: 8.1%) led by lower volumes in reseller business in Q4. Technology & Digital segment (collectively 74% of revenues) continue to drive topline growth with 2.2% and 7% QoQ growth. PSYS expects these segments to outperform based on positive client interactions, strong pipeline and increased need for Digital services. Alliance Business turnaround is expected to be gradual as it is continuing its’ focus on new tech areas – (closed new deals with Red Hat). Profitability is expected to be under pressure as client discounts and requested delays in implementation are in the talks. Persistent has taken senior team pay cuts (20-25%), variable cuts and also has scope to leverage S&M costs (systemic rationalization of 100-200bps here).

Outlook

We expect Persistent to continue to deliver strong performance in the Tech-services business led by its micro-focus approach in select capabilities and verticals. We have built in revenue/earnings CAGR of 7%/6% over FY20-22E and maintain our Accumulate rating on the stock with TP of `550, valued at 11x on FY22E earnings (implies 1.5x on PEG).

Even if one was to calculate returns from its January high, the index is still down 47 percent in more than three months.

The demonetisation, GST, and RERA increasingly made real estate norms stricter, resulting in a dramatic drop in cash transactions. Also, the demand for real estate was low due to high prices.

To revive demand, the government took some steps in 2019. The RBI, too, stepped in by reducing interest rates, but the lockdown has dealt a huge blow to the employment-generating sector.

Stocks were down 44-60 percent from their 2020 peak, pricing in a 20 percent plus capital value decline but the seven-year-long weak residential cycle set a good base to bounce back, CNBC-TV18 quoted Jefferies as saying.

Survivors would make disproportionate gains and consolidation would get a boost as disruptions weeded out the weak hands, it said.

Many companies in the last several years either shut down their operations or sold projects to other companies.

With effect from May 6, the centre hiked excise on petrol to Rs 32.98 per liter from Rs 22.98 per litre, while excise on diesel has been raised to Rs 31.83 per litre from Rs 18.83 per litre.
We reiterate IOC as our top pick, with a target price of Rs 168, valuing the company at 1.2x FY22 PBV,"" it added.
Its assumption on gross marketing margins on auto fuels stands at around Rs 4.2-4.5 per litre for FY21.
More importantly, the government aims to complete the divestment of BPCL, ""which is less likely to take place if marketing margins are sacrificed,"" said the brokerage.","Motilal Oswal reiterated IOC as its top pick, with a target price of Rs 168, valuing the company at 1.2x FY22 PBV.","After significant fall in oil prices due to low demand amid COVID-19 crisis, several states increased value added tax (VAT) on petrol and diesel in the lockdown period, which oil marketing companies (OMCs) passed on the benefits entirely to end consumers.

Any fall in oil prices is always good for oil retailers as they earn extra marketing margin on petrol/diesel sale.

Earlier this week, the central government significantly hiked record excise duty on petrol/diesel, which OMCs could not pass on to end consumers and as a result, their marketing margin fell sharply to single digit from double digits earlier. However, the government will get Rs 1.6 lakh crore in FY21 which can be a fiscal buffer.

With effect from May 6, the centre hiked excise on petrol to Rs 32.98 per liter from Rs 22.98 per litre, while excise on diesel has been raised to Rs 31.83 per litre from Rs 18.83 per litre.

""OMCs have absorbed the entire hike in excise duty without any increase in retail auto fuel prices, thus dragging down the supernormal marketing margins from Rs 17-19 per litre to around Rs 3.4 per litre for diesel and Rs 9.2 per litre for petrol,"" said Motilal Oswal.

OMCs had been enjoying huge marketing margins of Rs 17-19 per litre over the last couple of weeks as retail prices had not been changed since mid-March 2020 (except VAT changes in certain states that were fully passed on), but lower demand due to lockdown has posed a risk for OMCs.

""With the highest leverage to marketing, HPCL is the most vulnerable to any change in marketing margins and is the least preferred in pecking list though we reiterated buy rating with a target price of Rs 326 per share,"" Motilal Oswal said.

Hence, the brokerage further said, ""our preference stays with Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) among the OMCs, which, despite capex of Rs 20,000 crore annually, is expected to throw free cash flow of around 15 percent of its market cap in FY21/FY22, cumulatively.""

""IOCL is trading at 0.5x FY22 PBV, around 40 percent discount to the average during FY15-18 (the truly deregulated period without any pricing interference from the government). We reiterate IOC as our top pick, with a target price of Rs 168, valuing the company at 1.2x FY22 PBV,"" it added.

International Brent crude futures fell from around $70 a barrel levels to below $20 a barrel levels in April, while the same was trading around $30 a barrel at the time of publishing this copy.

Although Brent has risen around $5 a barrel in the last few days (which translates to an ask rate of around Rs 2.5 per litre on pump prices), diesel product benchmark prices have not risen.

""This means that despite the recent spike in crude, unless diesel cracks move up, OMCs do not need to take any significant hike in pump prices in the next few days if they are to maintain today's marketing margins,"" said Motilal Oswal.

Its assumption on gross marketing margins on auto fuels stands at around Rs 4.2-4.5 per litre for FY21. ""While we do not see any threat to our assumptions yet, it remains to be seen whether OMCs are able to pass on the increase in oil prices to end consumers going forward,"" it said.

More importantly, the government aims to complete the divestment of BPCL, ""which is less likely to take place if marketing margins are sacrificed,"" said the brokerage. It valued BPCL at 1.9x FY22E PBV and maintained neutral on the stock.

“At any given point of time in equity markets there would be certain sectors or companies which would be favoured by investors depending upon the circumstances of the market and/or tailwinds favouring a particular sector/companies,” Hemang Kapasi, Portfolio Manager – Equity Investment Products, Sanctum Wealth Management told Moneycontrol.

A display of strength and being leaders in their respective sectors – companies which are trading at a premium to their averages is a bullish sign for them, but not all companies could be termed buy, suggest experts.

“The above-mentioned names always trade at a premium to their historical averages as they are being the leaders in their product categories, zero debt, generate strong free cash flows and holds superior brands of their sector,” Vikas Jain, Senior Research Analyst at Reliance Securities told Moneycontrol.

“The broader markets have seen a sharp correction so these stocks look more expensive in co-relation to the earnings of the overall markets. There has been individual stock price correction like HUL and Asian Paints in recent weeks which gives an opportunity to invest in these high-quality franchisees,” he said.

What should investors do?

In these uncertain times of COVID-19 pandemic investor always prefer defensive companies which have low variation in terms of their earnings forecast, higher dividends and lesser volatility in their portfolios, suggest experts.

There will always be some companies that will trade at significant premiums because of strong fundamentals or robust business models, but given the fact we are staring at a recessionary phase, the story will change as economic reality hits D-Street.

“As an investor, it is not a good proposition to currently invest in these stocks, especially when larger markets are staring at a recession, because they are trading at high valuations,” Nirali Shah, Senior Research Analyst, Samco Securities told Moneycontrol.

“Once there is a clearer picture on the ground reality issues investors should begin investing in stronger names. Till then a wait and watch approach would be better,” she said.

The fact that the listed companies are trading at significant premiums to their historical averages, these firms also hold good fundamentals and can provide an opportunity to generate decent returns but in the long term as the short term, story is likely to remain volatile.

“Investors should remain cautious of the fact that markets may continue to remain volatile in the near future and short-term bullish actions may be riskier,” Gaurav Garg, Head of Research at CapitalVia Global Research Limited- Investment Advisor told Moneycontrol.

“Long term investing may be beneficial in the above-mentioned stocks considering their attractive valuations. Investors should invest with a long-term view,” he said.

2,"May 06, 2020 02:58 PM IST",Sunil Matkar,"Analysts bullish on SBI Life after FY20 earnings, expect 20-36% upside","However, given the COVID-19 disruption, SBI Life expects growth to slow down to single digits.
ICICI Direct also feels SBI Life seems to be well placed to stem the tide, though lockdown and economic slowdown is expected to make FY21 a challenging fiscal.
ICICI Direct expects SBI Life's business growth at around 11 percent CAGR and VNB margins at 17-17.5 percent in FY21-22.
We expect SBI Life to deliver strong FY20-22 VNB CAGR of 23.3 percent and RoEVs of around 13.4/15.1 percent.
We rate SBI Life a buy with a TP of Rs 975.","JM Financial, which has a buy rating with price target at Rs 860, believes SBI Life is better placed to weather the COVID-19 disruption given significant brand equity, an expansive multi-channel, pan India distribution network, cost leadership and access to parent's huge client base.","SBI Life Insurance Company share price gained 4.4 percent intraday on May 6 on growth numbers in FY20 despite disruption due to COVID-19 in the last 10 days of March.

The stock shot up 38.5 percent since March 23's closing, while today, it was quoting at Rs 745, up Rs 29.35 or 4.10 percent on the BSE at 13:34 hours IST.

Brokerages are bullish on the stock and expect 20-36 percent potential upside on likely steady growth in operating parameters in coming years, though there could be slowdown in overall business in first half of FY21 due to COVID-19.

The insurance company closed FY20 with an embedded value (EV) of Rs 26,300 crore aided by 30 percent YoY growth in embedded value operating profit (EVOP) mainly coming from a) healthy new business value (NBV) growth (17 percent), b) jump in persistency variance (Rs 240 crore versus Rs 5 crore last year) from steady product level persistency and modification in the treatment of group renewable business and c) other operating variances (Rs 190 crore versus Rs 6 crore) owing to release of risk margins baked in last year.

Margins improved 100bps YoY to 18.7 percent in FY20 aided by a) rising share of non PAR (7 percent of APE versus 0.4 percent last year) and protection (9 percent versus 7 percent) and b) 135-265bps YoY improvement in 25th-61st bucket regular persistency.

JM Financial, which has a buy rating with price target at Rs 860, believes SBI Life is better placed to weather the COVID-19 disruption given significant brand equity, an expansive multi-channel, pan India distribution network, cost leadership and access to parent's huge client base.

The brokerage expects an 18 percent embedded value CAGR over FY20-22E with 17-18 percent operating return on embedded value (RoEVs) with key risks being growth, persistency and unfavourable yield movement.

Prabhudas Lilladher also retained its buy rating with a revised price target of Rs 880 (from Rs 1,127 earlier) as it expects overall operating metrics like persistency, margins, costs etc to remain steady, though growth is expected to slow down a bit going ahead.

Annual premium equivalent (APE) for FY20 increased 11 percent YoY – inline with the industry, with a market share of 11 percent making it the largest private life insurer.

However, given the COVID-19 disruption, SBI Life expects growth to slow down to single digits. This was reflected in the (1.3 percent) hit to new business value (NBV) margins from operating assumption change to reflect negative operating leverage in FY21, JM Financial said.

Distribution wise, others (digital, Mconnect, YONO) recorded a 60 percent YoY growth in new business premium in FY20 with channel share at 20 percent, up 5 percentage points YoY.

Solvency ratio as of March 2020 stood at 194 percent, down 35 percent QoQ impacted by weak equity markets. In line with IRDA directive, the insurer cancelled dividend for FY20.

ICICI Direct also feels SBI Life seems to be well placed to stem the tide, though lockdown and economic slowdown is expected to make FY21 a challenging fiscal.

""Change in product mix, excellent operating efficiency, competitive position in individual protection business remain key drivers. Steady persistency, strong banca partnership, focus on improving digital footprint is seen supporting growth as well as earnings,"" said the brokerage.

ICICI Direct expects SBI Life's business growth at around 11 percent CAGR and VNB margins at 17-17.5 percent in FY21-22.

""Preferring to stay with businesses having lower balance sheet (unlike banks) and healthy fundamentals, we remain structurally positive on the stock,"" said the brokerage which maintained its buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 850 per share (earlier Rs 800).

Sharp movement in capital/debt market or significant claims remains a risk, it feels.

The private life insurer reported a 15.9 percent year-on-year rise in its March quarter (Q4) profit at Rs 530.67 crore, while its net investment income stood at a negative of Rs 6,677.19 crore in Q4 as against investment income of Rs 4,150.73 crore in the year-ago period.

SBI Life's net premium income stood at Rs 11,862.98 crore in Q4FY20, showing a 4.7 percent YoY increase. Company has made an additional reserve of Rs 60 crore for novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic over and above the policy level liabilities.

The life insurer had set aside a provision of Rs 107.26 crore in Q4 for diminution in value of investments and provisions for standard, non-standard assets.

SBI Life's solvency ratio stood at 1.95 in Q4 compared to 2.13 in the year-ago period and as against regulatory requirement of 1.50.

In Q4FY20 protection APE was at Rs 320 crore (up 28.0/39.1 percent YoY/QoQ, 11.8 percent share). Retail/group protection grew 6.2/66.7 percent YoY.

Emkay view

We assume coverage on SBI Life with a buy rating (overweight in NBFC Emkay Alpha Portfolio) and a revised target of Rs 892 at 2.5x March’22E EV (earlier Rs 1,100).

We believe that SBI Life's margin will improve owing to a gradual rise in protection plans' share along with the elevated share of non-par products. However, management needs to re-price its existing protection plans amid a rise in prices for reinsurance. We expect VNB margins to improve to around 19.6 percent by FY22 against around 18.7 percent during FY20.

HDFC Securities view

SBI Life's Q4FY20 performance was marginally below expectations, as NBP/APE declined 11.8/12.6 percent YoY due to the lockdown, while VNBM sustained at 20.7 percent (+90bps YoY). Despite SBI Life's ambition to post APE growth in FY21, given the macros, we remain skeptical.

Growth in Mar/Apr-20 has been severely impacted. Business is expected to decline over Q1FY21, however SBILIFE still believes that a single digit APE growth is possible in FY21E.

Over FY21, we expect COVID-19 and changes in personal taxation to cause significant disruption to insurance sales. We however take a longer term view on the business and appreciate the strong distribution footprint of its parent SBI (24k+ branches), improving protection share (FY20: 8.9 percent, up 212bps YoY), lowest operating cost ratios (9.9 percent), and improving margins (VNBM: 20.7 percent). We expect SBI Life to deliver strong FY20-22 VNB CAGR of 23.3 percent and RoEVs of around 13.4/15.1 percent.

We rate SBI Life a buy with a TP of Rs 975. Lower growth, renewals, and protection share are key risks to our call.

After witnessing a sharp rally in April, benchmark index Nifty formed a 'Bearish Island' reversal pattern in the first week of May 2020.

The recent rally was capped around a 50-day exponential moving average on a daily interval at 9,700 levels.

On May 6, 2020, initially, it was a guessing hour for the traders as the benchmark index swung both ways.

Later, Nifty continued holding its bullish bias and closed the index a percent higher.

Nifty once again respecting its 21-day exponential moving average and closed above the said average.

Geopolitical tensions between China and the USA and low April manufacturing PMI data created bearish sentiment among traders, which also increases volatility.

When we compare the current fall in the benchmark index with 2008 fall on the monthly chart, we can observe that first retracement after the fall was almost 50 percent in 2008 and then Nifty traded sideways in a narrow range for almost 4 months.

On the daily chart, Nifty has also completed its Bearish ABCD Harmonic pattern at 9,650 levels and slipped below the potential reversal zone (PRZ) level, which indicates Nifty may face strong resistance around 9,650 level.

Bank Nifty, on the other hand, neglecting its previous week's bullish setup, has witnessed a breakdown of the upward rising trend line on the daily chart and it is currently underperforming the benchmark index.

The banking index is capped under the 21 and 50-day exponential moving averages on a daily interval.

We believe Nifty will hold its bearish bias until and unless it neglects its Bearish Island reversal pattern which is formed at around 9,650.

In case the benchmark index fills the gap then there will be a sudden change in the sentiments. Supports are placed at 9100; a drift below this level will open the gate for 8,800 in the coming weeks.

Here are three stock recommendations for the next 3-4 weeks:

Voltas | Sell | LTP: Rs 463.90 | Target price: Rs 414 | Stop loss: Rs 495 | Downside: 10.75%

Voltas has breached its almost 30-month long horizontal trendline and is currently trading below its support level on a weekly timeline.

The majority of indicators and oscillators are negatively poised and are looking week to drift further.

The stock has drifted below its 50 & 100-day exponential moving average (EMA) on the weekly timeframe, which indicates bears are in full control to push prices lower.

The counter is likely to underperform the benchmark index which is visible on the Relative Strength (RS) indicator on a weekly interval.

Traders can short the stock in the range of Rs 460-466 for the target of Rs 414 with a stop loss above Rs 495 on a daily closing basis.

Larsen & Toubro (L&T) | Sell | LTP: Rs 839 | Target price: Rs 760 | Stop loss: Rs 885 | Downside: 9.42%

L&T has witnessed the Bearish Pole Flag pattern breakdown in the daily timeframe. The counter is trading in lower low lower high formation on a weekly timeframe which indicates the ongoing negative trend for the counter.

The stock has currently completed its pullback and looks geared for its next leg of fall. The counter is likely to underperform the benchmark index which is visible on the Relative Strength (RS) indicator on a weekly interval.

Traders can short the stock in the range of Rs 834-840 for the target of Rs 760 with a stop loss above Rs 885 on a daily closing basis.

Bharti Airtel | Buy | LTP: Rs 546 | Target price: Rs 610 | Stop loss: Rs 510 | Upside: 11.72%

After a two week consolidation, Bharti Airtel has seen a Cup and Handle pattern breakout on the daily scale.

The counter on the weekly chart has completed a V-shape reversal rally and is looking positive ahead.

The counter is currently outperforming the benchmark index which is visible on the Relative Strength (RS) indicator on a weekly interval.

Momentum oscillator RSI (14) is reading above 60 levels on the weekly chart with positive crossover on the cards.

Currently, the stock is trading above its trend line support and is sustaining above its 21 and 50 days EMA on a daily interval.

Traders can accumulate the stock in the range of Rs 543-549 for the target of Rs 610 with a stop loss below Rs 510 on a daily closing basis.

11,"May 06, 2020 01:26 PM IST",Sunil Matkar,"Analysts retain 'buy' on Varun Beverages but cut target, earnings estimates on lockdown impact","Varun Beverages share price gained 3.1 percent intraday on May 6 as most brokerages remained bullish on the stock but slashed price target and earnings estimates taking into account the impact of the lockdown.
The company maintained its operating margin on benign raw material costs and an easy base for the International business (last year Q1 margin was impacted by translation provisions).
Its revenue increased 23.3 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,676.4 crore, impacted by lockdown in the last 10 days of March.
Revenue growth lagged volume growth on higher salience of packaged water, characterised by lower realisations.
Consolidated volume grew 26.7 percent aided by the acquisition of PepsiCo’s South and West territories and healthy performance in international geographies (7 percent volume growth).","Despite disruptions, the company maintained its operating margin on benign raw material costs and an easy base for the International business.","Varun Beverages share price gained 3.1 percent intraday on May 6 as most brokerages remained bullish on the stock but slashed price target and earnings estimates taking into account the impact of the lockdown.

The stock has gained 20 percent in the last one month following a recovery in market recovery. It was quoting at Rs 625.05, up 0.83 percent, on the BSE at 1230 hours.

While retaining the “buy” call on the franchise of PepsiCo with a price target at Rs 760 from Rs 860, JM Financial said Varun posted resilient numbers amid disruption led by COVID-19.

""Varun Beverages' Q1CY20 result was better than our expectations driven by higher volume contribution from acquired territories and resilient performance from International geographies. Organic domestic volume performance (declined 13.7 percent) was a bit disappointing, though, as COVID-19 related lockdown had an adverse impact in the month of March (accounts for disproportionately higher volume share),"" it said.

The company maintained its operating margin on benign raw material costs and an easy base for the International business (last year Q1 margin was impacted by translation provisions).

The carbonated soft drinks and non-carbonated beverages maker reported a whopping 50 percent year-on-year growth in Q1 CY20 consolidated profit at Rs 60.06 crore, supported by tax writeback. Its revenue increased 23.3 percent year-on-year to Rs 1,676.4 crore, impacted by lockdown in the last 10 days of March.

Revenue growth lagged volume growth on higher salience of packaged water, characterised by lower realisations. Consolidated volume grew 26.7 percent aided by the acquisition of PepsiCo’s South and West territories and healthy performance in international geographies (7 percent volume growth).

On the operating front, its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) grew by 24.2 percent year-on-year to Rs 271.15 crore in the quarter ended March 2020.

""Operating performance was better than our estimates as weak domestic organic volume growth was offset by healthy contribution from newly acquired territories and resilient International business,"" said JM Financial.

EBITDA margin was flattish as sharp gross profit margin gains (up 281bps) on lower commodity prices was negated by adverse operating leverage (SG&A grew 32 percent).

The management withdrew its volume guidance for the year on demand uncertainties amidst the pandemic but was confident of maintaining operating margin, said JM Financial.

Benign raw material prices and reduction in trade/marketing spends would help negate the adverse impact from lower throughput, it said.

Net debt was largely maintained at Rs 3,200-3,300 crore sequentially and the management expects near-term debt maturities (Rs 450 crore) to be financed by operating cash flows. It also has unutilised credit lines of Rs 480 crore.

""This coupled with improved revenue trajectory post relaxation of lockdown recently should help navigate any liquidity related challenges in the near-term. Our confidence on business delivering healthy free cash flow to the firm (FCFF - Rs 1,000 crore) in CY20 and consequent net debt reduction drives our positive bias,"" JM Financial said.

Global brokerage house CLSA also maintained “buy” rating on the stock but reduced price target to Rs 745 from Rs 766 as it cut 2020 EPS estimates by 60 percent.

""There was sharp impact in India as lockdown extended, but there are multiple growth levers beyond 2020,"" said the brokerage, adding the company had 70 percent urban exposure and large OOH consumption (40 percent of sales).

However, ICICI Direct remained cautious and downgraded its rating to reduce with a revised price target at Rs 580 per share.

Unlike other FMCG companies, the company would be severely impacted by the lockdown, as manufacturing and supply chains were completely derailed, it said.

""Moreover, it also does not have advertising and promotion lever to reduce the cost at the time of crisis to protect margins. Though the management is confident of maintaining operating margins, we believe the recovery would be painful and prolonged,"" it said.

Moreover, higher interest cost was likely to impact earnings in CY20, it added.

In a conference call, compiled by JM Financial, the company said all plants were operational and Varun Beverages was meeting consumer demand. ""Inventory pile-up at March-end has been largely cleared in April,"" it said.

""30-40 percent of beverage demand is on-the-go impulse consumption and 10 percent is institutional; contribution from which is expected to remain negligible in the near term.""

International geographies like Nepal and Sri Lanka also witnessed lockdown in April, which would impact revenues in Q2CY20, the company said.

But EBITDA margin and EBITDA per case would be largely maintained in CY20. ""Softening in commodity prices (pet chips, sugar), lower schemes and promotions and savings in administrative overheads will help in this regard,” it said.

Many sectors and companies might undergo a sea-change in the post-COVID-19 world. The outbreak of the COVID-19 virus will have a subsequent effect on the physical and economic ecosystem, and the consumption pattern of the entire world will have a noticeable change, suggest experts.



For instance, work from home could become a normal practice, virtual markets will be strengthened further, defense systems against viruses would see more capital allocation, traveling patterns will change drastically, overall deleveraging etc., they say.



“This (COVID-19 & impact on sectors) will impact the long-term growth prospects of companies in the various sectors for better or worse. Although valuations have taken a beating, it is important to check these valuations in the context of the entire ecosystem,” Dinesh Rohira, Founder and CEO, 5nance.com told Moneycontrol.



“Buying into the future should be selective and done prudently judging the impact on consumption patterns, it is even more important during such volatile times. The near term will see a drop in growth due to the lockdown and social distancing, hence opportunities to buy can be plenty as volatility will continue. The idea is to remain prepared and invest in a staggered manner,” he said.



Rules to buy beaten-down stocks:



Experts feel that there are few factors which investors should keep in mind while buying beaten-down stocks especially at a time when the COVID-19 outbreak has virtually halted economic activity in most countries across the globe.



“As of now the extent of restrictive phase even after the opening of lockdown and the overall impact is very uncertain and thus one should invest only in companies, which are beaten down merely due to FII selling pressure but have an otherwise robust business model, or are low-cost producer, have no balance sheet risk and cater to the essential need of the consumers,” said Sameer Kaul, MD & CEO, TrustPlutus Wealth Management Services told Moneycontrol.



Here are the factors which one should keep in mind -





Expert: Sameer Kaul, MD & CEO, TrustPlutus Wealth Management Services



Study the balance sheet:



Few factors should be considered before hunting in such a volatile period. First and foremost is to look at the balance sheet risk in a tough period and see if the company has high leverage and high fixed cost. If that’s the case, it will be difficult for the company to service the obligations.



Free Cash Flow Generation:Does the company’s business generate free cash flow to sustain or survive its current obligations or will it require more capital as given that capital will be available easily in the current scenario? Does the company produce an essential commodity: Are the company’s products essential in nature or are they luxury or discretionary? In tough times, a lot of discretionary spending will be pushed forward or maybe down traded and thus growth may actually come down significantly. Expert: Dinesh Rohira, Founder and CEO, 5nance.com Growth prospects: In the current environment, there are some businesses that will benefit. These are the companies with products that have non-discretionary demand and low elasticity to price. Management dynamism: Many companies that can change quickly with the times will be at an advantage. Adapting products and services to the environment is key, such that it can benefit consumers. Valuations: Across the board, valuations have become reasonable. Still, recent financials can have a bearing on the continuing performance. Sometimes very low valuations can also mean that poor fundamentals are expected to remain or further deteriorate. De-leveraged companies: Companies with lower levels of debt are always in a better position to tide through tough times. They are the ones that have more capacity to survive and change according to the requirement. Technologically-driven businesses: Many companies implement technology to their advantage. It is even more critical during such times as social distancing could mean more virtual dependence.

On Tuesday, WTI Crude prices soared over 20.4 percent to close at $24.5 per barrel after many nations announced their plans to gradually revoke the coronavirus related lockdown which might lead to resumption in economic activities and boost the demand for the Crude. Many European and Asian countries along with some parts of U.S. and some other nations permitted people to go back to work. Resumption in business and industrial activities amid hopes of recovery in Vehicle traffic boosted the demand for Crude and pushed the prices higher. Oil prices were further supported after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies agreed to trim their production by 9.7 million barrels per day from 1st May, 2020. Production cuts amid expectation of rising global demand for Crude led to the surge in Crude prices.

The Nifty had touched the level of the entire fall to 50%, while NiftyBank managed to reach only up to 40 percent.","Index rollovers were also on the lowest side (81%), which shows traders were not comfortable when the market was hitting the levels of 9900 on the day of expiry.","Levels of 9,000 to 8,900 below 9,300 are important for the Nifty, and if the Nifty breaks the level of 8,900, it could fall to 8,700, 8,500 or even 8,000, Shrikant Chouhan, Executive Vice President, Equity Technical Research at Kotak Securities, said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.

Edited excerpt:

A) This time, of course, the ""sell in May and go away"" theory is going to apply. Levels of 9000 to 8900 below 9300 are important for the Nifty. If the Nifty breaks the level of 8900, it could fall to 8700, 8500 or even 8000.

The main reason behind this is that the Nifty has completed a pullback trend and once again it is now ready to convert in trending fall once again.

A) It is underperforming heavily and whenever there is a fresh round of selling in the market, the NiftyBank bleeds first. The Nifty had touched the level of the entire fall to 50%, while NiftyBank managed to reach only up to 40 percent.

Weakness is more likely and the index could fall to 17000 maximum, and below that 15000 or 14400 is also possible.

In the year 2008, when the market crashed due to the crises of “subprime” at that time as well the Nifty recovered after forming higher bottom whereas the NiftyBank made lower low (newer low) before recovering.

A) Based on rollover statistics, Reality, Consumer Durables, and Infra Capital Goods sectors are more likely to underperform. Based on Technicals, NBFCs and PSU banks should also underperform.

A) Index rollovers were also on the lowest side (81%), which shows traders were not comfortable when the market was hitting the levels of 9900 on the day of expiry.

However, they failed to take a short-selling bet at the exact technical level 9900(50% of the entire fall). However, technically, we feel that the Nifty would spend more time between the levels of 9000 and 9600 before falling to the levels of 8000.

Be short-seller around 9500/9600 levels or keep on reducing weak long positions.

2,"May 05, 2020 01:41 PM IST",Sunil Matkar,"Pick auto stocks with lower COVID-19 impact, strong balance sheets, say brokerages","Most auto companies, for the first time, reported zero sales in April, due to the nationwide lockdown.
M&M, TVS Motor, Bajaj Auto and Eicher Motors managed to export some vehicles.
Hence, the Pantnagar plant being operational does not help,"" Motilal Oswal said after talking to Bajaj Auto.
Leading agencies such as CRISIL and the World Bank have slashed India's FY21 economic growth forecast to 1.5-2.8 percent from 4.8-5.2 percent.
Further, dealer support from auto companies may also impact their margins in the near term.","The Nifty Auto Index has corrected by about 21 percent in the past two months, compared to an18 percent decline in the Nifty.","Most auto companies, for the first time, reported zero sales in April, due to the nationwide lockdown.

With factories and dealerships shut during the month, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) Mahindra & Mahindra (automotive segment), Bajaj Auto, TVS Motor, Hero MotoCorp and Maruti Suzuki reported almost no business.

However, as the government allowed agricultural activities (except in the containment zones), M&M and Escorts sold a few tractors. M&M, TVS Motor, Bajaj Auto and Eicher Motors managed to export some vehicles.

As it announced the third phase of lockdown that began on May 4, the Centre has allowed companies to start operations and dealers to reopen business, with the permission of state governments, in the areas that are coronavirus-free.

In an interaction with brokerage houses, OEMs indicated they were evaluating the possibility of restarting operations and waiting for permissions from state governments. Most of them have inventories of three to eight weeks.

Even after recommencing operations in some plants with a minimum manpower due to social distancing, getting spare parts would be difficult as most auto ancillary plants are in red zones or the coronavirus hot spots.

For instance, Bajaj Auto's two plants, including in one in Pantnagar, are operational. ""30 percent of Bajaj Auto's dealers are located in the green zone and 50 percent are in green/orange zone. Hardly 2-3 percent of its dealerships have reopened for business, and hence, there is near-zero demand for vehicles or spares. Hence, the Pantnagar plant being operational does not help,"" Motilal Oswal said after talking to Bajaj Auto.

M&M told the brokerage that tractor plants have not restarted yet, as the company had enough inventories (for around eight weeks) in the system, even at the plant level. ""Auto plants have started at Nashik, Haridwar and Igatpuri (engines). Chakan plant is yet to start,"" it said.

Hence, given the uncertainty due to COVID-19 crisis, brokerages expect the recovery to take longer time and all companies to see negative growth in FY21 against FY20 but there could be recovery in FY20 on low base of FY21.

""The COVID-19 pandemic has not only put the brakes on the initial signs of recovery seen in 2Ws/PVs but has also brought in uncertainty considering the several unknowns associated with its impact. This potentially deepens the impact of BS6 related price increase on FY21 demand,"" Motilal Oswal said.

Given the lockdown of nearly two months, the economy will likely take time to reach normalcy, say brokerages.

Leading agencies such as CRISIL and the World Bank have slashed India's FY21 economic growth forecast to 1.5-2.8 percent from 4.8-5.2 percent.

""Slower economic growth is likely to impact discretionary purchases such as automobiles and we expect the demand to remain under pressure in the near term. We expect recovery from FY2022 as long-term growth triggers, such as lower vehicle penetration and favourable demographics, are intact,"" Sharekhan said.

Moreover, pent-up demand (automotive volumes have been under pressure for the past six quarters) and pick-up in economic growth (post normalisation) would lead to a recovery from FY2022, it feels.

The Nifty Auto Index has corrected by about 21 percent in the past two months (compared to a correction of 18 percent in the Nifty) after the COVID-19 outbreak and the lockdown.

Most automotive stocks have also corrected sharply and are trading at 15-45 percent below their historical long-term average multiples.

Given the weak demand going ahead and attractive valuations, brokerages prefer to pick quality names less impacted by COVID-19 and have strong balance-sheet position.

""The demand is expected to remain under pressure in the near term on account of a slowdown in economic growth. Further, dealer support from auto companies may also impact their margins in the near term. Hence, we stay neutral on the automobile sector and prefer a selective approach,"" Sharekhan said.

The brokerage likes companies that are relatively less impacted by COVID-19 such as Balkrishna Industries and M&M (67 percent and 35 percent revenue from agriculture, respectively).

It also prefers companies that have a strong balance sheet and cash position and are leaders in their segments such as Hero MotoCorp, Exide Industries and Mayur Uniquoters.

Motilal Oswal also said valuations appeared attractive across companies but given the uncertain macro environment and threat of a possible prolonged impact of the coronavirus, it preferred stocks offering higher visibility of demand recovery, better competitive positioning, scope of higher operating leverage and strong balance sheet.

Eicher Motors and Maruti Suzuki are its top largecap picks, among mid-caps, it preferred Endurance Technologies.

ACC surprised positively in Q1CY20, beating our estimates on all fronts. Revenues fell 10.8% YoY to Rs 3,433 crore (vs. I-direct estimate of Rs 3,331 crore) led by a decline in cement volumes as the industry saw weak offtake in the quarter. Cement volumes for the quarter were at 6.56 MT (vs. I-direct estimate: 6.4 MT), down 12.1% YoY while RMC volumes fell marginally from 0.94 cum in Q1CY19 to 0.93 cum in Q1CY20.

EBITDA/t for the quarter was at Rs 789/tonne (vs. I-direct estimate: Rs 706/tonne), up 27.4% YoY. Thus, despite a steep drop in volumes, the EBITDA increased 12% YoY to Rs 518 crore (vs. I-direct estimate: Rs 450 crore) while EBITDA margins expanded 308 bps YoY to 15.1% The growth in operating performance is not reflected in PAT owing to steeply lower other income YoY, as the base quarter included a one-off to the tune of Rs 99 crore. PAT declined 6.6% YoY to Rs 323 crore (vs. I-direct estimate: Rs 304 crore).

Outlook

While ACC would face challenges on the P&L front in the near term, it is one of the few companies with no debt on its books and is expected to remain net cash positive despite capital expenditure on capacity addition. Return ratios are also expected to stay healthy despite a reduction in profitability. The recent correction puts ACC in a comfortable position on the valuation front. Thus, we maintain BUY on ACC, valuing the company at 12x CY21E EV/EBITDA to arrive at a target price of Rs 1,380 (implying an EV/t of ~$80).

The brokerage expects the stock to follow the same rhythm and resolve higher, thus offering aa fresh entry opportunity to accumulate.
Coromandel International | Buy | LTP: Rs 567.35 | Target price: Rs 688 | Upside: 21%Coromandel International is India’s second-largest phosphatic fertilizer player.
Ramco Cement | Buy | LTP: Rs 513 | Target price: Rs 665 | Upside: 30%While the sales volumes are being affected, rural and semi-urban areas have shown resilience.
ICICI Direct expects the stock to resolve higher and head to Rs 665 levels, as it is the 50 percent retracement of the entire decline (Rs 884-455).","These stocks may take off once the runway is clear, says the brokerage.","They say every adversity brings with it an opportunity and the equity market is no exception.

While uncertainty and gloom prevail in the market due to the coronavirus outbreak, brokerage firm ICICI Direct has identified stocks that have the ability to withstand a storm and may take off once the runway is clear.

""As the wisdom goes in the market, there are always opportunities in every adversity which exhibit bull moves even in a rough environment. We believe in the current uncertain scenario when many stocks are at multi-year lows and finding opportunities are challenging, identifying such resilient stocks and riding them in a rough environment like this will be rewarding and exciting,"" said the brokerage.

Structural turnarounds, relative strength rankings and Dow Theory bullish signals are three broad technical concepts to find the outperformers during the market decline in 2020.

As per the brokerage, under the structural turnarounds, there are stocks that have witnessed faster retracement of the entire January – March 2020 decline quicker, in April 2020, thereby, signalling a change of guard and a robust price structure.

On the other hand, the stocks that showed relative strength are ones that have remained resilient during the sharp decline of February and March 2020 and relatively outperformed the benchmarks, acting as defensive bets for investors. These stocks have steadied the portfolio performance in turbulent times, the brokerage said.

Stocks with Dow Theory bullish signals are the ones exhibiting a combination of higher high-low on yearly time frame (long-term degree) and supported by a similar signal on monthlies (medium-term degree).

""As the basic tenet of Dow Theory goes, the trend is a friend and therefore, staying invested with these companies may be rewarding,"" said the brokerage.

Here are the seven such stocks that the brokerage has termed as resilient:

Have a look:

Info Edge (India) | Buy | LTP: 2,510 | Target price: Rs 2,950 | Upside: 17.5%

In the near term, the slowdown in the economy could impact hiring activity (Naukri business) and real estate business (99 acres), leading to a deceleration in growth in the business, the brokerage said.

However, the should company to return to strong growth in the medium term, led by its leadership position in each of the above verticals.

Despite the slowdown, the brokerage expects the company to have a CAGR growth of 17.4 percent and 19.5 percent in revenues and profitability over FY19-22E.

On the technical front, the stock has been one of the major outperformers in the technology space and has seen a sharp recovery in the last three-four weeks from the decade-long rising demand line joining the major lows of CY09 (Rs 94) CY13 (Rs 276) and CY17 (Rs 796) placed around Rs 1,600 levels, said the brokerage.

Empirically, the stock went back to its life-time high after testing the key trend line. The brokerage expects the stock to follow the same rhythm and resolve higher, thus offering aa fresh entry opportunity to accumulate.

The monthly MACD is seen conversing with its nine periods average, supporting a bullish stance.

Coromandel International | Buy | LTP: Rs 567.35 | Target price: Rs 688 | Upside: 21%

Coromandel International is India’s second-largest phosphatic fertilizer player. It manufactures a wide range of fertilizers and markets around 4.5 million tonnes.

""Coromandel is poised to benefit from the recent increase in SSP prices, since the company has been selling SSP of around 5.6-6 lakh tonnes every year. Further, a recent increase in the prices of DAP can also assist the company to benefit from the higher realisation of NPKs,"" said the brokerage.

With an increase in the fertiliser industry volumes ahead of the Kharif season along with higher realisations and better EBITDA/tonne after a fall in the rock phosphate and sulphur prices, Coromandel International should post decent performance, it said.

On the technical front, the stock has relatively outperformed the mid-cap index and held its key support despite a volatile market around Rs 450 marked by a breakout area of long-term contracting triangle, thereby confirming a change of polarity and a 61.8 percent retracement of the last major upmove (Rs 337-642) at Rs 453, thereby offering fresh entry opportunity with a favourable risk-reward, said the brokerage.

On the oscillator front, the weekly stochastic is marching upward after recording a bullish crossover, indicating the continuance of a positive bias.

The brokerage expects the stock to challenge its lifetime high at Rs 642 and head to Rs 688 in the coming months, as it is 123.6 percent retracement of the last two months' decline (Rs 642–443), at Rs 688.

Relaxo Footwears | Buy | LTP: Rs 612.50 | Target price: 765 | Upside: 25%

Over the years, Relaxo has consistently posted strong performance, showing the company's fundamental strength .

""While volumes have trebled over the last decade (10-year CAGR: 10 percent), the transformation from being a basic slipper company to a conglomerate of higher value-added product categories has led the average

realisation to double to Rs 125 per piece (10-year CAGR: 7 percent),"" said the brokerage.

""Relaxo has a capital-efficient business model, generating healthy asset turns of 3 times and EBITDA margins of 15 percent. Stringent control in NWC (60 days) has led to average CFO/EBITDA at 55 percent.

Subsequently, D/E ratio fell from 1 time in FY13 to 0.1 times in FY19, with RoCE of more than 20 percent. We expect Relaxo to be the beneficiary of market share gains through a shift from unorganised to organised players.""

On the technical front, the stock has seen a change of polarity, as the previous major trendline resistance joining highs of CY15 (Rs 318) and CY18 (Rs 453) has reversed its role and is acting as support currently placed at Rs 500 levels.

As per the brokerage, the current decline from the all-time high (Rs 830 - Rs 500) achieved equality in magnitude with the 2015-2016 decline (Rs 318-188) and rebounded from key support at around Rs 500.

The brokerage expects the stock to maintain a positive bias and head to Rs 765, as it is 80 percent retracement of the entire decline (Rs 830–500).

Astral Poly Technik | Buy | LTP: Rs 930.20 | Target price: Rs 1,160 | Upside: 25%

""Despite, capacity addition and increase in dealer networks, Astral’s balance-sheet position has remained strong with efficient working capital management (average RoCE and RoE of 25 percent and 19 percent,

respectively),"" said the brokerage.

""While the company is likely to face near-term challenge due to lockdown, the long-term prospect of the company remained strong given the strong push of the government in the construction and infrastructure

developments.""

The company should record revenue, earnings CAGR of 18 percent and 17 percent in FY20E-22E, supported by about 15 percent volume growth in the piping segment, it said.

On the technical front, the stock has been in a secular uptrend and has been trading in a rising channel since CY17, highlighting a sustained demand at elevated levels.

""It has recently rebounded taking support at the lower band of the rising channel which also confluence with the 80 percent retracement of the previous rally (Rs 678-1,267) placed at Rs 790 levels thus provides fresh entry opportunity with a favourable risk-reward setup,"" said the brokerage.

The monthly 14 periods RSI is seen rebounding, taking support at its previous major yearly lows, thus supports the positive bias.

The brokerage expects the stock to form a base around the lower band of the channel and resume up move towards Rs 1,160, as it is 80 percent retracement of the entire decline (Rs 1,265-746).

Ramco Cement | Buy | LTP: Rs 513 | Target price: Rs 665 | Upside: 30%

While the sales volumes are being affected, rural and semi-urban areas have shown resilience.

On the pricing front, the management does not foresee a significant pressure on cement prices in the near term.

With most of the costs being variable in nature and with crude and petcoke prices seeing a significant correction, the company could see an improvement in profitability, which could partially offset lost EBITDA on account of lower volumes, ICICI Direct said.

""The debt of Rs 2,900 crore in its book which would increase further by upto Rs 500 crore to fund the capex and working capital requirement. However, we do not see this increase in debt to pose a threat to the

company’s balance sheet strength, as its D/E would remain well below 0.5 times,"" said the brokerage.

On the technical front, the stock has held its key upward sloping trendline, around Rs 460, despite elevated volatility and remains an outperformer within the cement space.

A higher base formation near key support of Rs 500-520 signals a positive bias and offers a fresh entry opportunity with a favourable risk-reward for investors to accumulate the stock.

""Structurally, over the past 24 months, the stock has retraced 80 percent of preceding 26 months rally (Rs 360–879), at Rs 460. A slower pace of retracement signals robust price structure,"" said the brokerage.

ICICI Direct expects the stock to resolve higher and head to Rs 665 levels, as it is the 50 percent retracement of the entire decline (Rs 884-455).

Laurus Labs | Buy | LTP: Rs 494.25 | Target price: Rs 620 | Upside: 25%

From being an anti-AIDS API supplier, the company is rigorously diversifying its product basket by moving into some niche APIs and formulations.

""Heavy balance sheet and subdued return ratios are attributable to aggressive capex in the past few years. However, with strong clientele, good execution track record, diverse product offering and relatively better

compliance track record, things should look promising,"" said the brokerage.

As per the brokerage, the company, being the largest supplier of some of the key anti-AIDS and other APIs in the world, can also benefit from the quest for a drug for COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus.

This would also likely generate better operating leverage on the back of better capacity utilisation, ICICI Direct said.

On the technical front, during the current month, the stock witnessed a faster retracement, as over the last four weeks stock entirely retraced preceding eight weeks decline (Rs 460 –295), indicating a robust price structure, in turn, suggesting structural turnaround, auguring well for next leg of the up move.

Structurally, the stock recorded a sharp rebound from the major long-term falling trend line placed around Rs 300, underpinned by positive divergence on the MACD indicator, as the price was forming lower low. Meanwhile, MACD was forming a higher low, indicating an impending positive momentum.

The brokerage expects the stock to form a higher base after the recent sharp upmove and pave the way to Rs 620, as it is near the life high of Rs 640 seen in July 2017.

Dixon Technologies India | Buy | LTP: Rs 4,590 | Target price: Rs 5,840 | Upside: 27%

The stock has formed a higher base after arresting intermediate correction near the key value area of Rs 3,000.

Structurally, the stock witnessed a faster retracement by recouping 19 months decline (Rs 4,494– 1,560) in just six months, indicating a structural turnaround.

Thereby, subsequent retracement offers fresh entry opportunities from a long-term perspective.

The brokerage expects the stock to resolve above the life high of Rs 4,895 and head to Rs 5,840, as it is 150 percent external retracement of the last two months' correction(Rs 4,895–2,990), at Rs 5,847.

On account of the global Covid-19 outbreak, we have seen Government of India announcing a lockdown across the country for 40 days in two phases till May 3, 2020. With this second phase of lockdown announced from April 15, 2020, sales loss for VST industries would be to the tune of 30-45 days. With shutting down of manufacturing facilities in the lockdown period, we believe this would negatively impact Q1FY21E numbers due to unavailability of cigarettes and as a result, consumers being unable to consume it.

Outlook

The company’s fundamentals are driven by a strong capital structure, steady cash flow and consistent dividend payment. VST has a robust margin profile with its operating margin at 32.2% for FY19.

Outlook

We believe Balrampur would generate strong cash flow over the next two years, which would lead to a significant reduction in working capital debt requirement. Moreover, it has kept payment to shareholders (dividend, buy backs) at 40% of earnings. Currently, the stock is trading at 1.1x & 1x FY20E & FY21E P/BV, respectively.

After settling with strong gains in the April series, the Indian market began the May series on a negative note with bears once again taking control.

Subdued global cues amid rising tension between the US and China hit the sentiment, while weak earnings of big domestic companies and India's record low April manufacturing PMI data aggravated the worries of investors.

On the derivatives front, we are witnessing a continuous addition of open interest at 9,400 and 9,500 call strikes that point towards a limited upside in the prices.

On the downside, however, marginal put writing was observed at 9,000 strikes which should act as strong support for Nifty.

On the technical front, secondary oscillators and price action is suggesting some consolidation in a broader range of 9,000-9,500 in the coming sessions.

At the current juncture, traders should remain focussed on stock-specific moves and are advised to trade cautiously tracking global markets as volatility is likely to grip the domestic markets in the coming few sessions.

Here are three stock recommendations for the next 3-4 weeks:

AstraZeneca Pharma India | Buy | LTP: Rs 3,220 | Target price: Rs 3,800 | Stop loss: Rs 2,700 | Upside: 18%

After falling back below Rs 1,900 in late March 2020, the stock saw a V-shape recovery on the daily charts and once again reclaimed Rs 2,900 levels in a short span of time.

At the current juncture, the stock has formed an inverted head and shoulder pattern on the daily charts and also given breakout above the neckline of the pattern formation.

The additional volume with the rising price is pointing towards a new upswing in the stock in the coming sessions.

Traders can accumulate the stock in the range of Rs 3,100-3,150 levels for the upside target of Rs 3,800 levels with stop loss below Rs 2,700.

Aarti Industries | Buy | LTP: Rs 1,138 | Target price: Rs 1,302 | Stop loss: Rs 940 | Upside: 14%

The stock saw a V-shape recovery from the lows of Rs 670 and managed to once again surpass above its 200-days exponential moving average on the daily charts.

At the current juncture, the stock is trading in a rising channel and has given the breakout above multi-month highs along with large volumes.

Secondary oscillators on the long term charts, also suggest that the trend is likely to continue towards the north in the coming sessions.

Traders can accumulate the stock in the range of Rs 1,075-1,110 levels for the upside target of Rs 1,302 levels with a stop loss below Rs 940.

Bharti Airtel | Buy | LTP: Rs 528.80 | Target price: Rs 625 | Stop loss: Rs 465 | Upside: 18%

After taking support at its 200-days exponential moving average on the daily interval, the stock has been consistently trading in a rising channel and maintaining its uptrend with the formation of a higher high and higher bottom pattern.

However, from the last few sessions, the stock was seen consolidating in the range of Rs 480-530 with constantly holding above its short and long-term moving averages on the daily interval.

This week, we have observed fresh breakout into the prices after prolonged consolidation. Additionally, a breakout has been seen above the bullish flag pattern which suggests further upside into the prices.

Traders can accumulate the stock in the range of Rs 525-530 for the upside target of Rs 625 levels with a stop loss below Rs 465.

This was the highest series to series gain since May 2009.
Though Nifty fell sharply yesterday, it is still trading above its 20-day SMA which is placed at 9,015 levels.
On the daily chart, the stock price is taking support at 20-day SMA.
On the weekly chart also, the stock price has broken out from the downward sloping trendline.",Use this sharp correction to accumulate long positons with SL of 8900 immediate resistance is seen around 9400 levels.,"Nandish Shah

Nifty plunged 566 points, or 5.74 percent, reacting to the last two days of weak global cues, and closing at 9,294 on May 4.

This is the highest single-day fall in percentage terms since March 23, the day on which Nifty made the lowest low on the closing basis during this downtrend.

From the bottom of 7,511, registered on March 24, 2020, Nifty has risen more than 31 percent to the high of 9,889 made last Thursday.

In the April 2020 series, Nifty surged 14 percent, the highest in a decade. This was the highest series to series gain since May 2009.

Though Nifty fell sharply yesterday, it is still trading above its 20-day SMA which is placed at 9,015 levels. This also coincides with the support of 8,980, which happens to be 38.2 percent retracements of the entire rise seen from 7,511 to 9,889.

The derivative market is also pointing towards the limited downside. On the derivatives front, we have seen put writing at 9,000 levels.

Moreover, lower stock futures open interest, lower leveraged positions despite 14 percent rise in the Nifty in the April series, lower open interest in the Nifty futures in terms of the number of shares (Nifty Futures OI is at fifteen-year low) and long rollover by FIIs in the index futures segment indicates that downside is limited in the market and derivative positions are not likely to be a milestone around the neck of the market.

Therefore, we believe that 8,950-9,000 levels will act as strong support, going forward.

Use this sharp correction to accumulate long positons with SL of 8900 immediate resistance is seen around 9400 levels.

Resistance was seen around 9,970 levels, which happened to be the 50 percent retracement of the entire downswing seen from 12,430 to 7,511.

To sum it up, we believe that though Nifty has fallen sharply it has not violated any important support levels.

Any correction from hereon on the back of weak global cues is a buying opportunity for the traders, we believe.

Therefore, our advice is to accumulate long positions in the Nifty with the stop loss of 8,900 levels. On the higher side 9,390 level would act as immediate resistance. Resistance is seen at 9,730 and 9,970 levels.

Here are three buy recommendations for the next 3-4 weeks:

GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals | Buy | LTP: Rs 1,483.30 | Target price: Rs 1,600 | Stop loss: Rs 1,410 | Upside: 8%

After taking support at 200-day SMA for multiple times, the stock price has broken out on the daily chart to close at three months high.

Oscillators like RSI and MFI are forming positive divergence on the daily chart. MACD line is placed above the central line Indicating bullish setup for the stock.

Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) | Buy | LTP: Rs 361.10 | Target price: Rs 390 | Stop loss: Rs 340 | Upside: 8%

The stock has recovered more than 5 percent from the lows yesterday by taking support at the upward sloping trendline adjoining the lows of March 25 and April 28, 2020, with higher volumes.

On the daily chart, the stock price is taking support at 20-day SMA.

RSI and MFI oscillators are forming positive divergence favouring the bulls.

Tata Communications | Buy | LTP: Rs 472.05 | Target price: Rs 520 | Stop loss: Rs 450 | Upside: 10%

The stock price has broken out on the daily chart by closing above the double top resistance level of Rs 455 with higher volumes to close at three year high.

On the weekly chart also, the stock price has broken out from the downward sloping trendline.

The stock is trading above all its important moving averages.

BHEL is India's largest & undisputed leader amongst Indian power plant equipment manufacturers.",Brokerages have a positive view on the stock with a target price of Rs 41 (upside potential of 74.5 percent) in medium to long term.,"After hitting a four-year low in March, when the market rallied in April, many PSU stocks participated.

Around 49 percent of stocks have gained more than 20 percent till date from March lows, while 45 percent stocks have gained 1-20 percent during the same period.

Power plant equipment manufacturer BHEL has gained 16 percent from its March lows, outperforming peers like ABB India (up 1.8 percent), Siemens (up 9.4 percent), etc. The rally was after the stock lost 71 percent in the last year.

Brokerages are bullish on the stock and expect the stock to rally up to 74 percent given the strong balance sheet, favourable risk-reward ratio after steep correction, and approach to attract foreign players for using its plants.

In an interesting development on May 4, BHEL has called for Expression of Interest (EOI) from foreign companies who wish to use its currently idle factories for manufacturing from India.

Emkay feels this could be a win-win situation for both - the foreign company and BHEL. The partnership can shorten the time to set up manufacturing facility for the incoming partner while also helping BHEL utilize its idle factories and employees.

""With BHEL offering a readymade solution in the form of factories, staff as well as pre-set vendor base and supply chain, this can open up several possibilities for BHEL in the longer term if handled well, in our view,"" said the brokerage while maintaining buy/overweight on the stock in sector Emkay Alpha Portfolio, with a target of Rs 37 (upside potential of 57.4 percent)

With power sector demand still struggling, this is a significant diversification move for BHEL, it feels. ""India has so far lagged in grabbing a share of the global supply chain shift from China to other emerging markets. One of the key reasons for this underperformance is a lack of a readymade land bank, delay in approvals, and fear of dealing with Indian bureaucracy.""

Globe Capital said as the ongoing economic disruption across the world due to COVID-19 has highlighted the dangers of manufacturing activities being concentrated in a single location, the need for diversification of supply chains & manufacturing has thrown up a huge opportunity for India which is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world and an attractive investment destination.

The government launched Make in India campaign in 2014 with the primary goal of making India a global manufacturing hub and also announced a lot of measures in terms of tax rates to attract foreign companies in 2019.

Emkay believes it is too early to comment on how much value this could add for BHEL as even in the most optimistic scenario, the first revenue contribution from such partnership will materialize only after 12-18 months.

However, it believes that the stock offers an attractive risk-reward profile with its current market cap at Rs 7,200 crore as against FY19 net cash of Rs 5,000 crore. ""BHEL’s net cash position (now around 70 percent of market cap) and receivable book of around Rs 38,000 crore (5x market cap) thus provide strong valuation support.""

Globe Capital also maintained a positive view on the stock with the target price of Rs 41 (upside potential of 74.5 percent) in medium to long term as the steep stock price correction coupled with strong balance sheet strength and long term potential make for an earning upgrade, though there would be a near-term weakness with slow orders and bulging receivables.

BHEL is India's largest & undisputed leader amongst Indian power plant equipment manufacturers. It is a single source of multiple solutions for energy, industry and infrastructure segments. It is the largest contributor to the country's installed generation capacity with more than 53 percent share.

The company has 16 manufacturing units, 8 service centres. It is the second largest employer in the Indian capital goods industry. The worldwide installed base of power generating equipment supplied by the company has exceeded 185 GW.

BHEL has a healthy order book of around Rs 1,09,000 crore for execution in 2019-20 and beyond. During the year, the company booked the highest-ever N4 orders in its transportation business segment and spares and services electric locomotive to Indian Railways.

In overseas markets, despite challenging circumstances, BHEL has secured 50 orders for projects, products, systems and services from 17 countries in the current fiscal.

Attractive dividend yield of around 8.91 percent; emerging business opportunities in e-mobility segment, EV chargers, electric buses, water treatment plant, sewage treatment plant etc; and government's focus on '24x7 Power for all' are some of key triggers highlighted by Globe Capital.

""We remain cautious on the asset quality front on the back of COVID-19 lockdown going ahead. As of April 2020, it has Rs 2,300 crore of the portfolio at stage 2, so we expect credit cost to remain elevated in the FY21,"" Narnolia Financial Advisors said.

The brokerage has reduced its FY21 estimates by 20 percent majorly on the back of overall slow down in the auto industry and higher provisioning on the back of rising default in the COVID-19 situation. It also decreased the price target to Rs 555 while having a neutral call on the stock.

But while maintaining buy call on the stock with a revised target of Rs 675, Motilal Oswal feels AU Small Finance Bank has reported a steady operating performance, though COVID-19 provisions have dented earnings.

""The bank has reported robust asset quality ratios; however, collection efficiency has declined due to the lockdown. AU SFB disclosed that moratorium has been availed for 25 percent of the loan book. Deposit growth has held strong, enabling the bank to maintain strong surplus liquidity and LCR of 133 percent, among other measures,"" the brokerage said.

Motilal Oswal estimated loan growth trends to remain soft at 15 percent in FY21 (20 percent AUM growth), while credit cost would increase to 1.7 percent in FY21, as it built in higher slippages, driving an 18/10 percent cut in FY21/FY22 earnings estimates.

Q) What is your view on Tech Mahindra and HUL which came out with results on Thursday?
A) Tech Mahindra Q4 result was below market expectations, which was mainly due to the disruption caused by COVID-19 related lockdown.
In the near term, our view on Tech Mahindra is negative, but positive in the mid-to-long term.
A) RIL result was also below the market expectations.","Since this doesn’t seem to be a fundamentally driven rally (14% rally in April), we are not confident of market sustaining at higher levels, says Sundar Sanmukhani.","After posting a 7 percent gain in just four sessions last week, market erased most of the gains on Monday, Sundar Sanmukhani, Head of Fundamental research desk, Choice Broking, said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.

edited excerpts:

A) On the back of weak global cues, the index gave a gap-down opening and continued its downside movement until the last meeting of the trading session.

The Index settled at 9,293 levels with the loss of 566 points along with its large constituents which were badly hit as well during the trading sessions.

In terms of sectors, private banks, financial services, and metals were the top losers.

At the present level, the Nifty50 index has strong resistance at 9,450 while on the downside, good support is seen at 9,170-9,000 level.

After posting a 7 percent gain in just four sessions last week, market erased most of the gains on Monday.

Brutal selling witnessed across the counters amidst subdued global cues as the tension rising between the US and China over coronavirus, weak earning from companies like Reliance, HUL, and Tech Mahindra and implementation of economic lockdown 3.0 also weighed on sentiments.

Selling got accelerated after India’s manufacturing PMI for the month of April reduced to a record low of 27.4.

Events that can impact the market for this week are services PMI data, government measures to combat the impact of lockdown extension, and the US-China relationship.

Q) How is May likely to pan out for investors. There is a very popular Wall Street adage ‘Sell in May and Go Away’? Do you think we could hold onto gains if not why?

A) Since this doesn’t seem to be a fundamentally driven rally (14 percent rally in April), we are not confident of market sustaining at higher levels. The market is almost 30 percent higher than the recent low. So, we are advising investors to partially book gains from the market.

Q) What is your call on Banking and auto stocks which have run up quite sharply in the week gone by?

A) We have a cautious to negative view of both sectors in the near-to-mid-term.

Q) What are the important factors which investors could track in the coming week and in the month of May?

A) As the initial lockdown started from the last 10 days of March 2020, we are not anticipating much negativity in the earning results of the companies. Nevertheless, the market needs to closely watch the earning results and the commentary of the companies.

Investors are expecting another stimulus package from the government and if the package is sufficient than the market could sustain the rally.

Q) What is your view on Tech Mahindra and HUL which came out with results on Thursday? What should investors do – buy, sell or hold?

A) Tech Mahindra Q4 result was below market expectations, which was mainly due to the disruption caused by COVID-19 related lockdown.

The company has not reported any significant deal cancellation but is operating at below capacity as clients struggled with the lockdown. In the near term, our view on Tech Mahindra is negative, but positive in the mid-to-long term.

For the whole sector, we are cautiously optimistic, but at the individual company level, it depends on sales-mix across various verticals.

HUL’s earning results too were below market expectations. The company reported a 7 percent fall in sales volume as against the consensus expectations of -4 to 4 percent.

EBITDA margin declined to 22.9 percent vs. expectations of 25.5 percent. The company indicated that it is currently operating at 70% utilization as compared to almost zero percent for the seven days after 25th Mar. 2020 (1st phase of lockdown).

We feel that despite reporting below-consensus results, it will remain in investor’s radar, because of its defensive nature in this uncertain environment.

Q) What are your view on RIL results and Rights issue and what should investors do?

A) RIL result was also below the market expectations. The company reported a consolidated PAT of Rs 6,348 crore. It has taken an inventory loss of Rs 4,267 crore, mainly due to the volatility in international crude prices. Net sales too were below the expectations and stood. GRM stood at USD 8.9 per barrel vs. expectations of USD 7.2.

Driving ahead of its plan to become a net-zero debt company by March 2021, the company has planned to raise massive equity of Rs.53,100 crore (i.e. around USD 7bn) via the right issue plan.

This is the first time the company is tapping the equity market in nearly three decades and this is the largest equity offering in Indian corporate history. The right issue will be a ratio of 1:15 with a price of Rs 1,257 per share

The issue will be structured as partly paid shares and payment of residual subscription amount over a period of time.

22,"May 05, 2020 11:01 AM IST",Sunil Matkar,This stock rallied 60% in April but experts see another 20% upside,"This is to cater to future growth in the ARV-/ANDA-led formulations segment as well as in new molecules/market share in the API segment.
Accordingly, Motilal Oswal said it had raised EPS estimates by 12.7/5.2 percent for FY21/FY22 to factor in enhanced business prospects in the FDF/Synthesis/Other API segment.
In the Q4FY20, its revenue grew 32 percent YoY to Rs 840 crore (versus Motilal Oswal's estimates of Rs 730 crore).
Subsequently, the EBITDA margin, at 22.9 percent (versus Motilal Oswal's estimates of 20.6 percent), was up 520 bps YoY.
EBITDA came in at Rs 190 crore (versus Motilal Oswal's estimates Rs 150 crore), up 71 percent YoY.","Laurus reported a strong set of results for Q4FY2020 with PAT at Rs 109.6 crore, growing 154 percent YoY and slightly ahead of Sharekhan's estimates.","Laurus Labs share price has surged 60 percent since March 30, outperforming Nifty Pharma index (up 35 percent) as well as Nifty50 (up 19 percent).

Brokerages expect another 18-20 percent upside in the stock on the back of increased focus on pharma post-COVID-19, lack of participation in the previous bull run, strong earnings and expected in-licensing opportunity from Remdesivir.

""Given the strong topline growth prospects, visibility on earnings, healthy return ratios and low debt-equity ratio would support the multiple expansions. We maintain positive view on Laurus Labs and expect 18-20 percent potential upside,"" Sharekhan said.

Laurus reported a strong set of results for Q4 FY2020 with PAT at Rs 109.6 crore, growing 154 percent YoY, slightly ahead of Sharekhan's estimates.

According to the brokerage, revenues and earnings are expected to clock a sturdy 13 / 23 percent CAGR over FY20-FY22 aided by an expected impressive performance of the formulations business followed by the custom synthesis business and ARV-API's.

""Approval of Remdesivir, the patented anti-COVID-19 drug is under trials in US and if approved could potentially benefit Laurus by way of in-licensing opportunity and would result in further earnings upgrades,"" Sharekhan said.

The United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) on Saturday granted emergency use authorisation (EUA) for the investigational antiviral Remdesivir of Gilead Sciences, to treat COVID-19 patients.

""We will continue to work with partners across the globe to increase our supply of Remdesivir while advancing our ongoing clinical trials to supplement our understanding of the drug's profile. We are working to meet the needs of patients, their families and healthcare workers around the world with the greatest sense of urgency and responsibility,"" Daniel O’Day, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Gilead Sciences said.

Motilal Oswal also reiterated buy call on the stock and raised price target to Rs 615 (from Rs 520 earlier) as it expects a 23 percent earnings CAGR, primarily led by a 22 percent sales CAGR in the finished dosage forms (FDF)/Other API segment and a 31 percent sales CAGR in the Synthesis segment over FY20–22.

Laurus Labs also ended FY20 on a robust note, with 2.3x FY19 earnings and the highest ever annual PAT at Rs 260 crore. This is attributed to growth in the formulations (FDF)/synthesis business and better operating leverage.

Laurus is in the process of further building up capacity in both the FDF and API segments. This is to cater to future growth in the ARV-/ANDA-led formulations segment as well as in new molecules/market share in the API segment.

Accordingly, Motilal Oswal said it had raised EPS estimates by 12.7/5.2 percent for FY21/FY22 to factor in enhanced business prospects in the FDF/Synthesis/Other API segment.

In the Q4FY20, its revenue grew 32 percent YoY to Rs 840 crore (versus Motilal Oswal's estimates of Rs 730 crore). Revenue was led by FDF (32 percent sales), which surged to Rs 270 crore from Rs 28.2 crore YoY, primarily owing to traction in LMIC (low-and middle-income countries), North America, and the European Union.

Other API (which contributed 11 percent of sales) increased 33 percent YoY to Rs 98.9 crore and Synthesis revenue (18 percent of sales) grew 34 percent YoY to Rs 150 crore further supported growth.

However, its growth was impacted by ARV API (32 percent of sales; down 16 YoY) and Oncology API (7 percent of sales; down 17 percent YoY).

The gross margin improved 400 bps YoY to 50.1 percent owing to a superior product mix. Subsequently, the EBITDA margin, at 22.9 percent (versus Motilal Oswal's estimates of 20.6 percent), was up 520 bps YoY.

EBITDA came in at Rs 190 crore (versus Motilal Oswal's estimates Rs 150 crore), up 71 percent YoY. Profit increased around 2.5x YoY to Rs 110 crore (against Motilal Oswal's estimates of Rs 61.7 crore), led by robust sales growth, superior margins, and a lower tax rate.

Laurus expects capex to be over Rs 300 crore in FY21, spread over the FDF/API segment, and intends to spend Rs 60 crore (FY21) on de-bottlenecking and Rs 200-250 crore on brownfield expansions (FY21/22) in the formulations segment.

""Within FDF, the company guided for three ANDA approvals, two launches in Canada, and a better off-take in Europe, in addition to increased traction in the ARV segment,"" said Motilal Oswal.

Laurus has received a fixed allocation in TLD tenders, in addition to any ad hoc business for FY21. Approval for TLE 400/600 is expected in first half of FY21, the brokerage said.

The company has completed its lab work for Favipiravir and is in the process of obtaining a commercialization license. It also launched Hydroxychloroquine (HCQS), anti-malarial drug, in March 2020 through a partner.

Edited excerpt:



Q) Sensex and Nifty rallied over 14% each in April. The Sensex is back above 33,000 while NIFTY reclaimed 9800. What is fuelling market rally on D Street?

A) The Indian benchmarks jumped nearly 3 percent on the closing of the long weekend for the market. The investors are still in hope for the stimulus package by the government.

The positive results of Covid-19 treatment trails by Gilead’s drug have added to the positive sentiment to the market. Sectors like metal, auto, IT and tech have majorly contributed to the rally.

The indications of easing of lockdown and partially giving permission to the manufacturing companies in the green zone to operate have added more value to the market.

Q) As we close the month of April on a positive note after a massacre in March –how is May likely to pan out for investors. There is a very popular Wall Street adage “sell in May and Go away? Do you think we could hold onto gain if not why?

A) The indices have closed in the positive note for the fourth consecutive session and posted the second-biggest weekly gain which rose nearly 8 percent in the week. The ongoing positive developments like plasma treatment, Gilead’s drug which is showing some promising results, and Oxford efforts for a vaccine will be the keynotes to the market in May.

The month of May will be crucial for India as cases surpassed 35,000 marks, although the doubling rate is quite good as compared to the earlier weeks.

Officially the lockdown will end on 3rd May, and the government is taking various steps for easing the lockdown and focusing on improving the economic conditions. So any stimulus package or confirmed vaccine is the key things to watch out in May.

Mumbai School of Economics and Public Policy (MSEPP) had published a paper studying the infection pattern of different countries like China, Australia, and New Zealand said that most of the states in India might stop reporting the new cases by 7th May and a whole country by 21st May.



If the market continued the rally and sustains above 9,750, we can expect it to break the next resistance level at 10,000 which is the crucial resistance level for Nifty and next level at 10,300, and on the downside, the support levels will be 9,700 and 9,500. Q) What is your call on banking and auto stocks which have run up quite sharply in the week gone by? A) The domestic markets settled positive on 30th April, which was supported by buying in financial, IT, auto and metal stocks. On the sectoral front, the Nifty Auto index was up 6.45 percent. Investors took positives from the news that India may attract $1.3 billion in passive flows as the country has moved into a new regime in which the FPI limit has been increased to the sector foreign limit. Close Indications of easing of lockdown measures and stimulus hopes helped drive the markets. Short covering and roll-overs in the market also contributed to the gains. Global markets today rallied after early results from US-listed Gilead's trial of its drug Remdesivir showed on 30th April, it helped speedy recovery from the illness caused by the Coronavirus. related news Rs 20 lakh crore stimulus package | Blockbuster gap up opening seen, Nifty may cross 9,500 levels

PM Modi speech on coronavirus: Here are the 5 pillars that will help make India self-reliant

PM Modi speech on coronavirus: Lockdown 4.0 will have entirely new rules, details by May 18 The risk of a correction has increased in the near term after the strong rally this week. Investors should keep this in mind and trade accordingly. Nifty has good resistance near the 10,000 mark. The Nifty50 has support near 9500 – 9600 zones. The Nifty Bank’s resistance is coming near 22000 - 22300 zones, and it has support in the 20250 – 20700 zones. Q) What are the important factors which investors could track in this week and in the month of May which could dictate the trend for markets? A) Nifty’s movement this week will be driven by the way forward for resumption of business after lockdown, an announcement of any stimulus package, and stock-specific earnings results. India is expected to roll out a stimulus package to help mitigate the damage from the crisis. The market has rallied 25 percent in a straight line and the future outlook is not going to be the same and things will not start improving in a straight line even after the lock-down is removed. So one needs to be careful about his positions and the sectors he/she has invested in. Q) What is your view on Tech Mahindra and HUL which came out with results on Thursday? What should investors do- buy, sell or hold? A) Tech Mahindra posted nearly 29 percent less profit than Q4 last year mostly owing to environmental changes and disruption due to COVID-19. A dividend of 5 rupees per share has been declared and therefore sending positive vibes on the street. The slowdown in economic activity is bound to impact IT industry however it could be seen that firm reported increased revenue than quarter ending March ‘19 which is a good sign and with the current trend of remote working and growing reliance on digital operations it is expected to see growing business opportunities for IT sector.



HUL reported nearly 3.5 percent less net profit on a YoY basis with a decline in the domestic customer base of up to 9% due to nationwide lockdown and EBITDA down by 40bps.The firm being in FMCG segment volume plays an important role in its profit margin and with extended lockdown, the buying may gain momentum again.Tech Mahindra - Buy at current level of 550-552 and hold.

After giving a breakout from the consolidation zone, Nifty extended its gain and managed to close above 9,800 mark last week.

The index gave range breakout and moved almost 500 points in two days with a gap-up move. Weekly Heikin Ashi candlestick pattern is flat bottom with a big body candle.

Nifty has given a breakout of Cup and Handle classical technical pattern which is having a neckline around 9,200-9,300 levels and the target as per pattern is 10,500 mark. Also, recently formed ABCD harmonic pattern's D leg can extend towards 161.8 percent of AB projecting bullish price action towards 10,250 levels. So under normal circumstances, the target for the recent rally is 10,250-10,500.

In the very near term, after the recent sharp rally, some consolidation or small retracement as mean reversion is highly probable. On the downside, all-important support is at 9,200. Only a decisive close below the crucial support of 9,200 will be an early sign of trend reversal.

Tata Steel: Buy Around Rs 295 | Target: Rs 340 | Stop Loss: Rs 270 | Upside: 15 percent

The 89-year-old Buffett, popularly known as ‘Oracle of Omaha’ is followed by investors across the globe including India.
A complete selloff could also turn investors back in India slightly cautious about the airline sector, suggest experts.
There is a likelihood of prices moving higher, and demand for travel is expected to remain low amid COVID-19 fears.
“With the mounting challenges ahead with subdued demand, short term investors should ideally exit or reduce to extreme levels from airline stocks to be invested in defensive play,” he said.","Experts advise investors to bring down their exposure in the airline. If they are long term investor then they could hold the stock, they say.","When Berkshire Hathaway Inc. sold its entire stake in the four largest US airlines in April, it dropped a hint to investors in other parts that the investment climate for the airline stocks might have change amid COVID-19 outbreak.

Chairman Warren Buffett said on Saturday at the company’s annual meeting that the “the world has changed” for the aviation industry. The conglomerate had held sizeable positions in the airlines, including an 11 percent stake in Delta Air Lines, 10 percent of American Airlines Co., 10 percent of Southwest Airlines Co., and 9 percent of United Airlines at the end of 2019, according to its annual report and company filings, Reuters reported.

Buffett said he “made a mistake” investing in the sector, which the pandemic has changed “in a very major way” with no fault of the airlines, leaving limited upside for investors, a Reuters report quoted.

The 89-year-old Buffett, popularly known as ‘Oracle of Omaha’ is followed by investors across the globe including India. A complete selloff could also turn investors back in India slightly cautious about the airline sector, suggest experts.

Companies would avoid official travel and would rather prefer conducting meetings over video conference. People, at large, will also avoid leisure travel (to the extent possible) at least for the next 6 to 12 months, suggest experts.

“I, therefore, agree with the views of ‘Oracle of Omaha’ that the airlines industry might not be a very lucrative sector in the short term. In India as well, the airline sector’s recovery will depend on a stimulus from the government as the margins in the sector are paper-thin,” Gaurav Garg, Head of Research, CapitalVia Global Research Limited-Investment Advisor told Moneycontrol.

“Warren Buffet has previously said that during the times when dark clouds fill the economic skies and rain gold, one should come out with buckets and not tablespoons, I would suggest to continue following the same in these times too,” he said.

Two of the listed companies have also taken a beating – InterGlobe Aviation has plunged a little over 25 percent so far in 2020 while SpiceJet is down by a little over 60 percent in the same period.

As airlines and airports prepare to resume operations, once the lockdown is lifted and the government gives the green signal – experts feel that it would not be the same. There is a likelihood of prices moving higher, and demand for travel is expected to remain low amid COVID-19 fears.

Given that the majority of the airlines companies are burdened with considerable debt in the balance sheet coupled with higher fixed cost in form of rental and other operating costs, the current pandemic is expected to pose further challenges for the aviation companies for an extended period, suggest experts.

Experts advise investors to bring down their exposure to the airline. If they are long term investor then they could hold the stock, they say.

“The travel restrictions across the world have put many related industries into a severe economic crisis which also includes the airlines business that has remained shut in India since late March. And the decision to divest the entire stake in US airlines stock by legendary investors (Warren Buffett) will certainly have a negative feedback loop for the aviation industry as a whole,” Dinesh Rohira is a Founder & CEO of 5nance.com told Moneycontrol.

“With the mounting challenges ahead with subdued demand, short term investors should ideally exit or reduce to extreme levels from airline stocks to be invested in defensive play,” he said.

Rohira further added that nevertheless, the lower commodity price coupled with the re-opening of the economy should help revive the businesses in the next 1-2 years from now, and therefore, investors with longer duration can still allocate capital to relatively quality stocks.

Tech Mahindra March quarter results were below analyst estimates, and the pain seen in the March quarter is likely to extend in Q1FY21, suggest experts. The IT company on April 30 posted a 29 percent year-on-year fall in profit at Rs 803.9 crore for the quarter ended March 2020.

Brokerages have a mixed view on the stock. While some maintained their positive stance on the stock, some cut the target prices and some analysts downgraded the stock to sell.

Morgan Stanley

CNBC-TV18 reported Morgan Stanley has maintained an 'overweight' call on the stock with a target price at Rs 680 and said that Q4 performance was weaker than expected as COVID-19 impaired growth and margin.

Morgan Stanley is of the view that the company has an opportunity to gain market share in BPS.

""Margin improvement plan could get pushed out by a year. We cut EPS estimates by 11 percent for FY21 and 3 percent for FY22,"" said Morgan Stanley.

It highlighted that the valuation of the stock is cheap against other large-cap peers.

Macquarie

As per CNBC TV-18, Macquarie has an 'outperform' call on Tech Mahindra but cut the target price to Rs 738 from Rs 839.

""Higher exposure to BPS business will put pressure on growth in near-term,"" said Macquarie, adding that the delay in deal ramp-ups due to COVID-19 induced uncertainty will weigh on growth.

CLSA

CLSA has maintained 'outperform' call on Tech Mahindra but cut the target price to Rs 635 from Rs 920, reported CNBC-TV18.

""We see headwinds from slowed discretionary spending in the enterprise segment. Margin will be under pressure in FY21 on lower volumes and pricing discounts. We cut revenue estimates by 16-17 percent and margin by 200-250 bps for FY21-22,"" said CLSA.

CLSA added that continued strong deal win momentum provides hope of a recovery in the second half of the year.

Jefferies

Jefferies has a buy call on the stock. It raised the target price to Rs 615 from Rs 590.

As per CNBC-TV18, Jefferies underscored that the disappointing Q4 as communications business was surprisingly weak and the performance of the company was disappointed on both revenue growth & EBIT margin.

Jefferies finds a total contract value of $505 million a silver lining.

""Revenue decline led by communications though some of this is likely transitory. 5-G spend ramp-up and demand-side pressures will be key going forward,"" said Jefferies.

Kotak Institutional Equities

Kotak has a 'buy' call on Tech Mahindra but cut the target price to Rs 360 from Rs 680. The brokerage expects Tech Mahindra's EBIT margin to decline to 10.2 percent in FY21.

Kotak said it saw growth normalisation in FY22 after a poor FY21. It has trimmed FY21-22 EPS estimates by 10-22 percent on Q4 disappointment.

Investec

Investec has a buy call on the stock with a target price at Rs 630.

""Q1FY21 is likely to be another quarter of meaningful revenue declines. We cut our FY21 and FY22 EPS estimates by 4.3 percent and 0 percent, respectively,"" said the brokerage.

Investec said its estimates factor in revenue drops over Q1 and Q2 and weak margin in the first half of the year and added that the revenue and margin performance in Q1 will be key to stock performance.

Motilal Oswal

Motilal Oswal downgraded the stock to Neutral with a target price of Rs 590.

Sharp revenue decline and EBIT margin contraction were disappointing given the COVID-19 impact on March were only limited to just two to four weeks across the core geographies.

This indicates what lies ahead in subsequent quarters when the full impact of the COVID-19 crisis is likely to kick in. Tech Mahindra has been slower in enabling work-from-home (WFH) access in comparison to its peers, indicating supply issues may not completely ease out in the near-term.

Motilal Oswal downgraded its EPS estimates over FY21–22E by 22–25 percent in light of the disappointing results and downbeat commentary.

Edelweiss Securities

Edelweiss Securities maintained its buy rating on Tech Mahindra post-March quarter results but slashed its 12-month target price to Rs 640 from Rs 796 earlier.

“We believe the current quarter pain is likely to extend in Q1FY21 as well and is in line with our trimming of estimates (on 9th April 2020) for the company and the sector. In view of the current uncertainty and lower growth, we trim our multiple to 14.5x (16.0x earlier), in line with a cut in our sector multiples,” said the note.

11,"May 04, 2020 07:33 AM IST",Nishant Kumar,"Hot Stocks | Here's why ONGC, Bharti Airtel are a buy for short term","In fact, in the recent meltdown, the stock prices plunged to the year 2004 lows.
Importantly, the recent rally in the stock prices is backed by considerably higher volumes.
So, we recommend going long on a decline towards Rs 75 for a positional target of Rs 92 in the comingdays.
In addition, prices have now closed above the higher end of Bollinger Band which indicates strong momentum upmove after the recent consolidation.
Looking at all the above evidence, we sense a strong upside in the counter.","March was one of the worst months for our market, but fortunately, this was followed by a stupendous April during which, we managed to recoup 50 percent of the damage done in March.","Sameet Chavan

During the last week of March, our market somehow managed to stabilise and then saw some decent recovery thereafter.

Until April 28, Nifty had been struggling to surpass 9,400 mark, but due to strong buying momentum in the last couple of sessions, Nifty finally broke out and went on to close convincingly above 9,800-mark.

March was one of the worst months for our market, but fortunately, this was followed by a stupendous April during which, we managed to recoup 50 percent of the damage done in March.

It was a broad-based rally and some of the laggards like financials and auto contributed heavily, which provided credence to the move.

Looking at the overall setup, Nifty is very much poised for an extended move towards 10,200-10,400, which would be seen as a strong hurdle for the market.

Traders should start lighting up positions in this zone and then wait for further signals.

There is an important development happening on the global front over the last couple of days, which cannot be overlooked.

US President Donald Trump has threatened China to impose new tariffs which could lead to the resumption of a trade war. Market participants across the globe look intimidated, resulting in a sharp decline across the globe.

SGX Nifty, too, reacted negatively to this development and is showing a massive cut. On May 4, we need to see how our market reacts to it and if they open in line with SGX Nifty, 9,300 and 9,100 would be seen as

crucial supports.

If the market fails to hold that level, it will apply brakes on the recent optimism and in this case, we will have to revisit our view.

However, if our market doesn’t react to the tune of SGX Nifty and shows some buying interest at lower levels, the above-mentioned bull case scenario remains valid.

So, all eyes would be on global development which would dictate the immediate path of action for our market.

Here are two stock recommendations for the next 3-4 weeks:

ONGC | Buy | LTP: Rs 79.75 | Target price: Rs 92 | Stop loss: Rs 68 | Upside: 15%

This one of the ‘Maharatna’ companies of India has been underperforming for several years now. In fact, in the recent meltdown, the stock prices plunged to the year 2004 lows.

Fortunately, after marking a low around Rs 46, we witnessed a decent recovery in this stock and in the process, it has managed to confirm a breakout from the ‘Symmetrical Triangle’ pattern.

Importantly, the recent rally in the stock prices is backed by considerably higher volumes.

So, we recommend going long on a decline towards Rs 75 for a positional target of Rs 92 in the coming

days.

Bharti Airtel | Buy | LTP: Rs 514.55 | Target price: Rs 560 | Stop loss: Rs 491 | Upside: 9%

This stock has been consolidating above the 50 and 89-EMA for the last few sessions and has now broken above this consolidation on the upside, confirming a continuation pattern known as ‘Pennant’.

The said breakout is supported by a good increase in volume. In addition, prices have now closed above the higher end of Bollinger Band which indicates strong momentum upmove after the recent consolidation.

In addition, the momentum oscillator RSI is pointing northward after the recent dip, supporting the buy call.

Looking at all the above evidence, we sense a strong upside in the counter.

12,"May 04, 2020 10:45 AM IST",Kshitij Anand,Sell in May and go Away? 10-year data suggests otherwise,"It is an investment strategy in which investors sell stock in May and re-enter markets in early November.
Nifty50 closed in the green in 6 out of the last 10 years, data from AceEquity showed.
Investors’ wealth rose by nearly Rs 16 lakh crore in April.
FIIs were net sellers of equities worth nearly Rs 21,000 crore in May 2013, followed by Rs 16,000 crore outflows in May 2014, and nearly Rs 10,000 crore selloff recorded in May 2019.
They poured in more than Rs 13,000 crore in May 2018, followed by over Rs 9,000 crore buying in May 2017, and over Rs 7,000 crore in May 2016.","Data from the last 10 years suggest that bulls got an upper hand seven times in the month of April. Nifty50 closed in the green in 6 out of the last 10 years, data from AceEquity showed.","After rallying over 14 percent in April, all eyes are on the month of May which is often linked with the age-old Wall Street saying ‘Sell in May and Go away’.

It is an investment strategy in which investors sell stock in May and re-enter markets in early November. It’s based on the belief that the market produces lower returns from May to October.

In terms of benchmark returns, bulls have managed to push the index in the green almost 60 percent of the time in May in the last 10 years, while there has been some selling from foreign investors as they remain net sellers 50 percent of the times in the same period.

Nifty50 closed in the green in 6 out of the last 10 years, data from AceEquity showed.

The Nifty50 jumped nearly 8 percent in May 2014, followed by a 4 percent rally in May 2016 and a 3.4 percent gain in May 2017 — three of the biggest gains in May in the last 10 years.

On the other hand, Nifty fell four times in May in the last 10 years — in 2012 (over 6 percent), 2010 (3.6 percent), 2011 (3.2 percent), and 2018 (0.03 percent).

Most experts feel that the age-old saying might just come true for D-Street in 2020 because the 30 percent rally from the March lows was more of a relief rally, and investors will be better off booking profits at higher levels.

“At the current level, we have a cautious view in the market, unless the global health environment improves with a better treatment & vaccination in the future. We term this as a bear rally, the sustainability of which is difficult in the short-term given rising cascading economy effect,” Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told Moneycontrol

“We are advising traders to capitalise on this rally and book gains in the near-term. Long-term investors can accumulate in the dip,” he said.

Investors’ wealth rose by nearly Rs 16 lakh crore in April. The average market capitalisation of the BSE-listed companies grew from Rs 113.48 lakh crore from March 31 to Rs 129.41 lakh crore recorded on April 30.

D-Street seems to be taking comfort in the fact that the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) has granted emergency use authorisation (EUA) for the investigational antiviral remdesivir to treat COVID-19 patients.

Apart from the use of new drugs, investors are also pinning hopes on second stimulus package from the government to cushion the economic impact of COVID-19 on India.

But, a possible Trade War between the US and China could derail the market recovery. The US President Donald Trump said his administration was crafting retaliatory measures against China as punishment for the coronavirus outbreak, once again sparking tariff fears that rattled markets through much of the last two years, said a Reuters report.

“Domestic markets have been mirroring the directions from the US markets. Positives start, as the Indian market is taking cues from the international markets, driven by the success of the Gilead drug and expectations of stimulus and partial opening up of the economy in green,” Pankaj Bobade, Head- Fundamental Research, Axis Securities Limited told Moneycontrol.

“It is too early to talk about the market movements for the month of May. The political activities on the international platforms are heating up, which are likely to have an impact on international market movements,” he said.

FII Activity:

Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) pulled out more than Rs 65,000 crore from the cash segment of the Indian equity markets in March, as per provisional data, and little over Rs 5,000 crore in April.

If we look at the historical data, they have net sellers about 50 percent of the time in the last 10 years in May. FIIs were net sellers of equities worth nearly Rs 21,000 crore in May 2013, followed by Rs 16,000 crore outflows in May 2014, and nearly Rs 10,000 crore selloff recorded in May 2019.

On the other hand, mutual funds were mostly net buyers in the last ten years in the month of May. They poured in more than Rs 13,000 crore in May 2018, followed by over Rs 9,000 crore buying in May 2017, and over Rs 7,000 crore in May 2016.

The monthly expiry and crossover of key resistance levels resulted in short covering in the index options due to which the markets ended at the highest point in the expiry month.

Q. As we close the month of April on a positive note after a massacre in March, how is May likely to pan out for investors. There is a very popular Wall Street adage ‘Sell in May and Go Away’? Do you think we could hold onto gains if not why?

A. The Nifty50 closed 14.1 percent higher for the April expiry to post one of the best months of gains in the last decade with strong positive momentum across sectors and stocks.

The Nifty50 has rallied by about 31 percent from its swing low of 7,511 recorded in March. The pullback started since the countrywide lockdown came into effect and got stronger with global markets pullback.

The adage ‘Sell in May and Go Away’ did not hold true in recent years as we have ended positively in May month for the last five years.

We believe there could be some more positive momentum till 10,400 levels and then correction could set in as the 200-week average and 38.2 percent pullback from its 52-week lows are placed in the range of 10,350-10,400 levels.

The later part of the results season is always very weak which could also pull the markets lower in the second half of May.

Q. What is your call on banking and auto stocks which have run up quite sharply in the week gone by?

A. The Nifty Bank was being a laggard in the current up move but private banks gained traction post the results of HDFC Bank and gained further traction as other private banks announced their full-year results.

PSU banking has remained flat trading near to its all-time lows and we could expect a strong up move in May as the monthly candle ends in a Doji pattern and the set up on daily and weekly charts looks positive.

Auto sector has moved up 33 percent from its 52-week low. We expect some weakness as individual stocks are being in the overbought zone on the daily charts and on the higher side the 200-Day average is placed at 7,200 levels which will act as a strong resistance. The risk-reward is not favourable from current levels.

Q. What are the important factors which investors could track in the coming week and in the month of May which could dictate the trend for markets?

A. In the coming week, D-Street's reaction from Nifty50 companies like HUL, Reliance Industries and Tech Mahindra would be the key to watch and how the global markets pan out.

We remain positive on markets and any correction near to 9,400 levels would be a good entry point as the resistances will act as support from current levels.

The Q4FY20 results season would move into the third week and selectively, the lockdown will also open in non-containment zones of various states which will be important to watch for the manufacturing and industrial activities to resume.

Q. What is your view on Tech Mahindra and HUL which came out with results on April 30? What should investors do — buy, sell or hold?

A. HUL has already witnessed a sharp correction in the past two weeks and the results were largely in-line with expectations as it has gained market share in the overall business and low volume growth is mainly due to low stocking.

Tech Mahindra posted a weak set of numbers. We expect a weak opening for the stock but one should buy on dips near its support at lower levels in the range of 490-500 levels. It could be a good entry point for the stock to accumulate on declines.

Q. What are your view on RIL results and the rights issue, and what should investors do? Do you see a positive/negative reaction on May 4 (Monday)?

A. The results are in-line except for the exceptional loss which dragged the overall profits. But consumer business and Jio subsidiary reported stronger growth for the quarter.

Reliance Industries’ rights issue of Rs 53,125 crore is priced at Rs 1,257, the ratio of 1:15 held by shareholders, which will enable shareholders to increase the holdings at a lower price compared to the closing of Rs 1,467 per share.

We expect a positive opening on May 4 (Monday), but the upside could be capped as multiple resistances are placed in the range of 1,550-1,600 levels near to its previous tops.

O2C may get Rs 3.5 lakh crore of valuations then the stock could cross magical Rs 10 lakh crore market cap again,"" he added.
He too was disappointed with the rights issue pricing but said that the fall in topline, EBITDA and EBIT of Reliance Retail given the lockdown was not disappointing.
The proposed rights issue would be the first by RIL in three decades.
""The rights issue is a step towards the company's target of becoming a zero-net debt company by end of current fiscal.","Vikas Jain of Reliance Securities said the rights issue would enable shareholders to increase the holdings at a lower price compared to Thursday's closing of Rs 1,467 per share.","Reliance Industries (RIL) met street estimates in its January-March quarter results fueled by stellar growth in Jio, retail and digital businesses. However, an exceptional loss of Rs 4,267 crore due to the fall in oil prices and demand destruction following the coronavirus outbreak capped profits.

Analysts are of the opinion that the stock may witness profit booking on Monday primarily due to a steep fall in equity markets as trade tensions between the US and China resurfaced.

SGX Nifty on Friday was down nearly 500 points whereas benchmark indices rallied nearly 8 percent last week.

Another reason for profit-taking could be the sharp rally seen in Reliance share price recently. The stock shot up 67.5 percent since March 23 to Rs 1,467.05 on April 30 amid growth in the telecom business and Jio-Facebook deal.

""Reliance has rallied more than 60 percent, it could see some sell-off in a couple of weeks due to weak global cues, but that will be a buy or there will be a good time to buy at Rs 1,257, the rights issue price,"" Prakash Diwan of Altamount Capital Management told CNBC-TV18.

Prashanth Tapse, AVP Research at Mehta Equities also feels technically RIL may see an attempt of profit booking at the current levels as it has seen a rally from Rs 875.65 (March 23) and Thursday's close Rs 1,467.05 (April 30).

But experts maintained a positive stance on the stock given the expected growth in the new-age business of Jio and Retail which are yet to be factored in.

They see tremendous growth in RIL after Q4 FY20 and Q1 FY21, once the lockdown induced pain is soothed.

According to them, there are multiple moats for the company such as the expected growth in consumer businesses, ongoing due diligence with Saudi Aramco, expected hiving off oil-to-chemical (O2C) business, another Facebook-like deal in Jio Platforms. They also expect RIL to become net debt-free ahead of schedule which could drive market capitalisation of the business back above Rs 10 lakh crore soon.

""We still have Saudi Aramco deal on track, so it is a very different premium attached to optionality on the stock. Though there was a disappointment on the pricing of the rights issue, the stock will definitely come back as the new-age businesses will start getting pencilled in,"" Prakash Diwan said.

""Reliance is not extremely expensive even at Rs 1,400 plus level given the kind of projections of the new-age business of Jio and Retail. O2C may get Rs 3.5 lakh crore of valuations then the stock could cross magical Rs 10 lakh crore market cap again,"" he added.

SP Tulsian of sptulsian.com also said, ""I don't think Q4 numbers or EPS estimates for FY21 are relevant at this point of time. Saudi Aramco due diligence is on track which gives certainty that deal is going to happen.""

""The company will be moving before NCLT for hiving off O2C business and its commitment to raising Rs 1 lakh crore by Q1 FY21. Hence, if we add cash flow of Rs 40,000-50,000 crore for FY21, the company will be able to achieve the target of making it debt-free on a net of cash basis, because the net debt as of March 31 FY20 is Rs 1.61 lakh crore,"" he added.

He too was disappointed with the rights issue pricing but said that the fall in topline, EBITDA and EBIT of Reliance Retail given the lockdown was not disappointing.

The company reported gross refining margin at $8.9 a barrel, which was much ahead of street estimates of $7.2-8.0 a barrel. GRM in Q3 FY20 was at $9.2 a barrel.

Reliance Jio reported a healthy 72.7 percent sequential (177 percent YoY) increase in profit at Rs 2,331 crore with 387.5 million subscribers as of March 2020 against 370 million in the previous quarter, while average revenue per user increased to Rs 130.60 from Rs 128 crore QoQ.

""GRM at $8.9 a barrel is out of the box and far better than expectations. Jio ARPU is a tad lower as we were expecting at Rs 135, but incrementally they also added subscribers, tweak in data pack which will have a strong impact on current quarter's earnings (Q1FY21),"" Prakash Diwan said.

The company announced India's biggest rights issue of Rs 53,125 crore, in the ratio of 1 equity share for every 15 equity shares held by shareholders, at a price of Rs 1,257 per share against Thursday's closing of Rs 1,467.05 per share. The proposed rights issue would be the first by RIL in three decades.

""The rights issue is a step towards the company's target of becoming a zero-net debt company by end of current fiscal. Promoters are expected to fully subscribe to the rights issues which will instil confidence in investors mind about promoters commitment to the business in addition to improving the balance sheet strength. We believe investors should take this positively,"" Ashish Chaturmohta, Head of Technical and Derivatives, Sanctum Wealth Management told Moneycontrol.

Vikas Jain, Senior Research Analyst at Reliance Securities said the rights issue would enable shareholders to increase the holdings at a lower price compared to Thursday's closing of Rs 1,467 per share.

Reliance Industries is expected to complete the capital raising programme totalling over Rs 1.04 lakh crore by Q1FY21, which includes the investment by Facebook in Jio Platforms, the upcoming rights issue and the previous investment by British Petroleum in FY20.

In addition to the Facebook investment, ""RIL has received strong interest from other strategic and financial investors and is in good shape to announce a similar-sized investment in the coming months,"" said the company.

With strong visibility to these equity infusions, RIL is set to achieve net-zero debt status ahead of its own aggressive timeline.

Mukesh Ambani in his AGM speech in August last year said, ""We have a very clear roadmap to becoming a zero net debt company within the next 18 months that is by March 31, 2021.""

While maintaining a buy call with a target at Rs 1,601, Prabhudas Lilladher said it tweaked estimates for FY21/22 as it believes RIL is well placed to capitalize on growth opportunities in the digital and retail space.

""Fundraising plans of Rs 1 lakh crore will help RIL to tide over the tough post-COVID-19 pandemic situation, especially in the hydrocarbons business,"" the brokerage added.

Motilal Oswal also maintained buy call on the stock and said, ""RIL's Q4 FY20 consolidated and standalone EBITDA was in line with our estimates.""

The brokerage valued the stock at Rs 1,618 per share (from earlier Rs 1,589), based on SOTP with equity values of Rs 358 per share for the core business, Rs 500 (earlier Rs 450) for Retail and Rs 760 (earlier Rs 750) for Jio.

""We value the core segment of Refining and Petrochem at 6.0x FY22E EV/EBITDA, factoring in the enhanced delayed coker capacity, the widening of crude blend window for maximizing distillate yields prior to the IMO and the revival in Petchem margins for the company under its flexible feedstock utilization,"" the brokerage said.

The Nifty50 witnessed an extraordinary move on the expiry, which saw the index rallying by over 3 percent on April 30. Bank Nifty outperformed last week and so did many short-heavy sectors.

Last week’s contribution of nearly 10 percent is almost equivalent to the expiry gain for the index. The Nifty, on the other hand, had a better run in this expiry adding gains of close to 14 percent from an expiry-to-expiry basis.

However, Open Interest (OI) tells a different story. First, the rollovers and Bank Nifty were above three-month average while the OI data for Nifty indicates more pressure by unwinding participants leading to 17 percent drop in OI expiry over expiry (EoE), Bank Nifty did see augmentation in this expiry as well.

This could be seen in the 21 percent rise in OI for Bank Nifty EoE. The Nifty’s unwinding can be attributed to a logical development of short-covering this expiry as the short hedges unwind in a rising market.

Bank Nifty looks to have rolled forward the additions through the April expiry. Looking at the daily OI activity, Bank Nifty has added the majority of shorts, indicating the persistence of pessimism getting rolled forward.

On an aggregate basis to OI has augmented for overall futures participation in excess of 12 percent which is a reasonable increment.

This, along with the fact that 94 out of 143 participating stocks carried forward longs into May expiry is an indication of a slight bit of overconfidence considering the current state of global uncertainty prevailing especially around the novel coronavirus pandemic. Sentimentally, the key indicators are to a certain extent into their recent extremes.

On an aggregate basis to OI has augmented for overall futures participation in excess of 12 percent which is a reasonable increment. Carry forward of longs into May expiry is an indication of a slight bit of overconfidence considering the current state of global uncertainty prevailing especially around the pandemic.

Sentimentally, the key indicators are to a certain extent, into their recent extremes as India VIX has more than halved this expiry.

While some reduction can be attributed to the reduction of the shock impact due to passage of time, yet, considering the mean-reverting nature of such variables like India VIX, it makes sense to pay attention to the sharp move pushing the index into the relative extreme.

Looking at option composition too, we are getting a similar vibe as the OIPCR for the Nifty has ended the week at 1.89. The contribution of last day rise could be one of the factors but the ratio is at its year high.

In a situation when we are completely immobile physically, this kind of optimism is alarming.

Anomaly in Index and Stock futures OI action along with overshooting Optimism indicated by sentiments, prices as well as heavy participation calls for caution; hence, a short hedge via weekly Bear Put Spread is advised.

Bear Put spread is a moderately bearish strategy. The strategy is built by buying a Put close to the current market price of the underlying and selling the same expiry Put but of a strike lower than the Put bought.

The sold Put strike would be limit the profit but fund the put buying. Profits are limited to the difference between strikes minus the net premium paid.

Strategy details

Considering the indications from global exchanges with deep cut expectations for Nifty in the opening on May 4, referencing any trade based on April 30’s close would not be prudent. Hence, instead of strategy details, strategy guidelines are mentioned.

As soon as opening volatility settles in 5-10 minutes of opening, one may choose a Strike closer to the current market price to BUY and at least 200-300 points lower strike to SELL.

This quick guide to the strategy would help in getting the details of pay-off ready before execution.

We are advising traders to capitalise on this rally and book gains in the near-term. Long-term investors can accumulate on dips.

A) Banking stocks are under the assistance of supportive measures by RBI & the government to support the economy. The highest concern is on SME, MSME, and continuity of business in the near to medium-term.

Even though a good amount of weak credit growth and higher provisions during Q1 and Q2 is factored in price, we remain cautious due to asset quality concern & downgrade in outlook.

Having said that private banks' premium valuations have beaten down, presenting an opportunity for long-term investors. Banks having exposure in the retail segment with a good branch presence, better loan mix, and comfortable balance sheets like HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, and SBI will stand out.

In the auto sector, the stocks that have lower debt and a rich balance-sheet are expected to outperform in the auto segment, post-COVID-19.

The auto index has given a return of 30 percent in the last 1 month from its low due to the expectation that the government’s stimulus package on the economy will benefit the industry & sales will improve in Q2.

However, improvement in demand and change in consumer spending might have a longer impact on the sector. Currently, the index is trading at 18x on a 1-year fwd basis which is 13 percent premium to its five-year historical average at 16x.

We have a cautious view in the short-term with a selective Buy rating on Maruti Suzuki, Escorts, and Minda Industries Ltd.

A) A large portion of Indian company results is likely to be released in the month of May with a negative bias. Possibility of opening the economy, the size & effectiveness of the fiscal stimulus to be announced will define the trend of the domestic market in the near-term.

While globally, the grim economic data, news regarding treatment, and vaccination are the watchlist.

A) Tech Mahindra posted weak results as profit fell by 29 percent on a YoY basis to Rs 803 cr. The EBIT margin is a big miss and came at 10 percent.

Telecom is a very important business mix for the company which has a positive outlook due to higher consumer spending in telecom & data.

We believe that the entire IT space will go through transformation post-COVID pandemic and with respect to Tech Mahindra, as most companies have delayed their 5G CAPEX that could impact the telecom revenue for the stock. We are downgrading forecast and outlook on the stock.

COVID-19 has impacted HUL in terms of demand and supply but comparing to other stocks and sectors the outlook has not deteriorated much.

On the demand side, already subdued rural demand could further impact by lower-income with the weaker sale of crops amid labor and supply chain issues.

But, monsoon will play a vital role in demand. As the economy improves, we expect V-shape recovery and have a HOLD rating.

The company plants are running at 70-75 percent of the capacity and is expected to be among the best performing stock in the near to medium term given the cautious trend of the market.

A) The medium to long term outlook of RIL has significantly improved on account of its plan to consolidate its key assets which will create value to shareholders through strategic development, equity infusion, and deleveraging of balance sheet.

The proposed right issue (Rs 53,000 crore) is a step in that direction. The total amount of proceeds is likely to be about Rs 1,04,000 crore (Rights, Facebook & BP), excluding transactions with Aramco & Financial investor.

Going ahead, there will be challenges in cyclical business that would be offset by digital & retail business. However, in the near term, weak oil prices are likely to impact its cash cow (refining and petro-chemicals business), dilution in equity, high leverage, and uncertainty in business post-COVID, which will impact the performance of the stock in the near to medium-term.

Why to Buy Petronet LNG?

In technical analysis, an Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern describes a specific chart formation that projects a bearish-to-bullish trend reversal.

An Inverse Head and Shoulders reversal pattern forms after a downtrend, and its completion marks a trend reversal to uptrend. In the standard Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern, we connect the high after the left shoulder with the high created after the head.

A trendline is drawn by connecting these highest points of the two peaks, which is called 'Neckline'. This trendline is the most important component of Inverse H&S pattern.

Petronet LNG is trading in an upmove while forming Inverse Head & Shoulders pattern and this pattern has been completed on a close above Rs 228 mark. This stock is trading near strong resistance line standing around Rs 228 levels which is tested multiple times earlier & it also suggests a strong bullish bias to continue further after a breakout.

Recent formation of Inverse Head & Shoulders classical pattern has given a breakout by trading only above Rs 228 mark, suggests buying in the stock for higher targets of Rs 275. Volume will also add further insight while trading these patterns. Decent volume participation while giving breakout will also give support to Inverse H&S pattern.

Figure.1. Inverse Head & Shoulders pattern and buy signal on Petronet LNG

Buy Signal

1. A decisive close above neckline (Rs 228) of Inverse Head & Shoulders pattern will give a pattern breakout.2. Prices are already trading above short-term moving average 20 DMA which will define bullish short-term trend.3. Mid-term moving average 50 day moving average defines mid-term trend is very well augur with bulls as prices are sustained and trading above it.

4. Decent volume participation while pattern breakout will also give additional confirmation.

Profit Booking

Target as per Inverse Head & Shoulders pattern is calculated by adding height of head (H) to neckline which comes to Rs 275, however one can book profits near previous swing high which is around Rs 270 levels.

Stop Loss

Entire bullish view negates on breaching of right shoulder on closing basis and one should exit from long position. In case of Petronet, it is placed around Rs 203 levels.

Conclusion

We recommend buying Petronet LNG above Rs 228 levels with a stop loss of Rs 203 for higher targets of Rs 275 as indicated in above chart.

edited excerpts:

Q) What is fuelling market rally on D-Street?

A) As the coronavirus brought the global economy to a standstill, the market world over witnessed a rout. In April, bounce back was seen after a vertical fall.

Initially, it was led by defensive sectors like FMCG and Pharma. Recently, it was fueled by Auto and Commodity relief rally along with Banks and IT sector.

A) The Nifty50 has now retraced 50 percent of the whole decline, so the index is approaching a resistance zone in terms of retracement levels.

It needs to be seen that the market can sustain at current levels and some profit booking may be expected.

A) Though banking stocks have rallied recently, they are not out of the woods yet and are still within a range of 6 weeks. So, banks need to show follow-through action from here on for a fresh rally to emerge.

The auto sector was in pain long before the pandemic hit and was one the weakest sector. So, for now, it seems like a relief rally coming off a low base.

A) Relaxation in lockdown, economic policy measures, and how the activity at the ground is picking level is likely to dictate the market direction, going forward.

Results season has already started and it would provide a peek on how earnings will be impacted in next quarter.

A) The HUL result was disappointing with a volume de-growth of 7 percent, the number not seen even during the demonetisation period. Personal care and ice cream segments witnessed a soft demand leading to the weak performance of the company.

In the short run, the stock is expected to underperform given the expensive valuations and poor quarterly performance. However, in the medium term, HUL should farewell as it will be a key beneficiary of the rural demand recovery and one of the least impacted companies from COVID-19 led disruptions.

Tech Mahindra too disappointed the street with a 29 percent fall in earnings. COVID-19 led disruptions are bringing extraordinary changes in the business models of the IT industry. Hence, it will be important to see who all are able to adapt to the rapid changes.

While the stock has corrected by about 35 percent over the last two months, it not expected to rally in the near term in absence of any strong trigger.

A) RIL reported a resilient performance in all the segments even in this challenging quarter. The company also announced a rights issue of Rs 53,125 crore. This is a step towards the company's target of becoming a zero-net debt company by end of current fiscal.

Promoters are expected to fully subscribe to the rights issues which will instil confidence in investors' minds about promoters’ commitment to the business in addition to improving the balance sheet strength. We believe investors should take this positively.

Some analysts have also downgraded the stock to ‘sell’.

Tech Mahindra March quarter results were below analysts estimates, and the pain seen in the March quarter is likely to extend in Q1FY21, suggest experts. The IT company on April 30 posted a 29 percent year-on-year fall in profit at Rs 803.9 crore for the quarter ended March 2020.

The company posted a net profit of Rs 1,132.5 crore in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal and Rs 1,145.9 crore profit in the December quarter of FY20.

EBIT for the quarter came at Rs 949.6 crores and the margin was 10 percent. EBIT was 17.9 percent below, while margin was 180 bps below CNBC-TV18 estimates.

Revenue from operations stood at Rs 9,490.2 crore, down from Rs 9,654.6 crore reported in the December quarter. However, it was up from Rs 8,892.3 crore reported in the March quarter of FY19.

""Tech Mahindra posted weak results as profit fell by 29 percent YoY. EBIT margin was a big miss too. Telecom is a very important business mix for the company which has a positive outlook due to higher consumer spending in telecom & data,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told Moneycontrol.

""We believe that the entire IT space will go through transformation post-COVID-19, and with respect to Tech Mahindra as most companies have delayed their 5G CAPEX that could impact the telecom revenue for the stock. We are downgrading forecast and outlook on the stock,” he said.

We have collated views from various experts and brokerage houses on Tech Mahindra post-March quarter results:

Expert: Umesh Mehta, Head of Research, Samco Securities

The pandemic and consequent lockdown in India and across the globe has disrupted the IT industry which will impact Tech Mahindra’s revenue as well. It would be advisable to 'sell' Tech Mahindra as there are other large players which can provide better-investing opportunities going forward.

Bharti Airtel Ltd: Buy| LTP: Rs 496| Stop loss: Rs 470| Target: Rs 600| Upside 20%

The stock has seen a major multi-year consolidation between 540 and 220 odd levels on the monthly chart. The last up move from the bottom end of the range has been on high volumes indicating accumulation at lower levels in the stock.

The recent correction from all-time of 569 has taken support at the 200-Days moving average around 400 odd levels. Also, in the process, the stock has retraced 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the major rise from 254 to 569 levels.

On the short-term, the stock has formed a double bottom formation between 400 and 490 odd levels on the daily chart. Post the breakout price, it has retraced back to neckline level and formed a bullish pole and pennant continuation pattern on the daily chart.

Thus, the stock can be bought at current levels and on dips towards 485 with a stop loss below 470, and a target of 600 levels.

“In our view, financials and consumer staples, which led the previous bull market, may give way to consumer discretionary and healthcare,” the note said.

For the past seven years, financials have been investors' favorite sector, representing almost 30 percent of the Nifty market cap at the peak. Meanwhile, the re-rating of consumer staples has taken the sector's metrics to well over 2-SD above their 20-year average.

“But, if history is a guide, the leadership of the next bull market could shift to consumer discretionary and healthcare. These sectors are unloved, under-owned, and undervalued based on the metrics we have used,” highlighted the note.

The rational which the global investment bank gave behind the analysis is that both sectors are underweighted in institutional portfolios, have lost share in the Nifty's market cap, are reporting profitability well below history, and are trading below historical average relative to valuations.

Although new cases spiked from 146 as on March 31 to 1823 as on April 30, according to India COVID-19 tracker, but D-Street took comfort from the various stimulus packages announced by central bankers across the globe including India, say experts.

“Indian markets cheered on hopes of another possible fiscal stimulus from the Indian government. Emerging markets like Thailand, Malaysia, and developed markets like the US have supplemented their economies with stimulus packages in the range of 10-15 percent of their GDP which has triggered markets and brought about the strong retracement from the lows,” Umesh Mehta, Head of Research, Samco Securities told Moneycontrol.

“Hence, the current market rally in India is nothing more than a globally orchestrated rally. Going head markets would largely take cues from any updates on the lifting of the extended lockdown, quantum and coverage of the possible stimulus package from our government as well as domestic mutual fund’s behavior,” he said.

Technical View:

The Nifty50 broke the four series losing streak as it gained 14 percent in the April series. This is the highest series to series gain since May 2009.

The Nifty50 continued to form higher highs – higher lows for the fourth consecutive week and formed a bullish candle on both weekly and monthly scale.

“Now, the 50% retracement level of the entire fall from 12430 to 7511 levels, which is placed at 9970, would be immediate hurdle for the Nifty and a sustainable move above the same may pull the index towards 10200 - 10300 levels,” Chandan Taparia, Derivative & Technical Analyst, Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd told Moneycontrol.

“On the flipside, downside support is shifting higher to 9700 and then 9400 levels. Traders are advised to trade with positive bias till the time Nifty holds above 9700 zone,” he said.

Since it is the beginning of the May monthly series, open interest (OI) activity is scattered at various strikes. The maximum Call OI is placed at 9500, and then towards 10,000 strikes while maximum Put OI is placed at 9,000, and then towards 8,500 strikes.

edited excerpts:

Q) A strong day to end the week! The Sensex is back above 33,000 while Nifty50 reclaimed 9,800. What is fuelling market rally on D-Street?

A) Indian markets cheered on hopes of another possible fiscal stimulus from the Indian government. Emerging markets like Thailand, Malaysia, and developed markets like the US have supplemented their economies with stimulus packages in the range of 10-15 percent of their GDP which has triggered markets and brought about the strong retracement from the lows. Hence, the current market rally in India is nothing more than a globally orchestrated rally.

Q) As we close the month of April on a positive note after a massacre in March – how is May likely to pan out for investors. There is a very popular Wall Street adage ‘Sell in May and Go Away’? Do you think we could hold onto gains if not why?

A) Given that Indian markets’ sentiment is largely driven by sentiments in the global markets, especially the US market, the month of May could be possibly driven by sentiments in the global economy.

One cannot ignore the fact that Indian market participants are dearly waiting for a big fiscal stimulus package 2.0 and given the limitations government have with its finances, not much is expected which can keep prices under pressure.

To add to it, once the lockdown ends, bourses might factor in the ground reality which isn’t rosy.

A) Quarterly earnings of HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, and IndusInd Bank were not as bad as the Street expected. And therefore, the rally which was witnessed in financials was an event-driven relief rally.

In addition to this, the management of Axis Bank stated that only 10-12 percent of the bank’s borrowers by number have opted for a moratorium and HDFC Bank too provided similar numbers; however, they are hopeful that if lockdown gets lifted quickly the ground level situation may start to normalise.

Moving on to the auto stocks, even before this lockdown, the auto industry was going through its worst phase, but nonetheless, it is expected that an adequate government stimulus might address this sector’s difficulty.

Given the oversold levels with the slightest news of production approval at some factories, investors jumped right in to accumulate stocks at reasonable valuations.

A) Going head, the markets would largely take cues from any updates on the lifting of the extended lockdown, quantum and coverage of the possible stimulus package from our government as well as domestic mutual fund’s behaviour from the reported inflows and outflows for the month of April.

A) HUL’s quarterly show missed Street estimates on an overall front and the underlying volumes contracted by 7 percent as demand fell due to the COVID-19 lockdown, the highest decline since demonetisation quarter.

The profit declined 1.20 percent on a YoY basis to Rs 1,519 crore for the quarter ended March whereas revenue fell 9.4 percent to Rs 9,011 crore largely due to the disruption in supply in March.

However, HUL’s resilient business model, low debt and healthy balance sheet would help steer the company through these tough times, investors are advised to hold this stock from a long-term perspective.

Tech Mahindra disappointed investors with its quarterly numbers wherein profits fell around 30 percent and revenue declined 1.70 percent. During the year, the company’s margins narrowed 450 basis points to 7.70 percent.

The pandemic and consequent lockdown in India and across the globe has disrupted the IT industry which will impact Tech M’s revenue too. It would be advisable to SELL Tech Mahindra as there are other large players which would provide better-investing opportunities going forward.

A) Since Reliance Industries is a conglomerate, certain business segments have performed and surpassed expectations while some have disappointed. Excellent performance by Reliance Jio with ARPU coming in at Rs 130.6 has further offset the poor performance of Petrochemicals and Retail.

But, on a whole, the result was largely in line with the market’s views. However, the rights issue ratio of 1:15 at a price of Rs, 1257 per share is slightly overpriced which might cause a challenge to attract retail investors, and hence there can be a slight dip in its stock on Monday.

Investors holding it for a long term horizon of 3-5 years can remain invested as the efforts to reduce debt, digital growth, deal with Facebook, etc. are all positives for the company.

Thus, it is quite clear that a good recovery for the credit card industry is expected.
Already, SBI Card has narrowed the borrowing limit.
Therefore, altogether the risk of NPA for the credit card industry seems better than others.
Thus, SBI Card being the sole listed player in terms of the credit card industry with extensive credit card portfolio would regain strength.","Given the uncertainties surrounding COVID-19, change in consumer behavior is much likely & thus the value for insuring oneself would be acknowledged as a pure risk cover rather than just an investment product.","Manali Bhatia

The current situation demands of investment opportunities in various stocks or sectors that one can look into. Valuations for most companies have dropped to nearly 50 percent making them lucrative.

Clearly, it's the right time for investment opportunities. But, in which stocks and sectors, is the question.

The global markets are settling now as the number of cases abroad is saturating. In India too, expected easing of restrictions in tranches is may fuel market further. A stimulus package has already been announced and another one is likely soon. Thus, at this time it is prudent to invest in a well-diversified portfolio consisting of strong fundamentals, healthy ratios and one which has the potential to re-energise post lockdown.

Given the uncertainties surrounding COVID-19, change in consumer behavior is much likely & thus the value for insuring oneself would be acknowledged as a pure risk cover rather than just an investment product. As a result, this would lead to higher demand for high margin protection products in the future. Thus, investment in such companies would give healthy returns once the market gets back on track.

ICICI Prudential Life is a leader in private sector life insurance companies in India with an AUM (assets under management) of Rs 1.71 lakh crore and in-force sum assured of approximately Rs 13.60 lakh crore. Its strong brand, robust distribution network, sustainable business model, and high persistency ratio adds competitive strength to its business model. In the next 3-4 years, the VNB (value of new business) is expected to double.

Similarly, Nippon Life Asset Management, being the sole promoter of Nippon India (75 percent holding) & given its credibility worldwide, shall remain stable. No doubt, the pandemic is likely to create a deep impact on profitability and earnings. But, we believe Nippon can shape up again in the next 3-6 months. It's true that whole Mutual fund industry cannot collapse, though revenue streams and cash flows may get minimal to some extent. Therefore, the near term outlook seems challenging but, we believe the industry will reclaim its lost ground with meaningful pick up in asset growth over the long term. In fact, growing consumer traction towards investment in financial assets, limited players, low penetration, huge market potential, high return ratios and zero debt, could lead the stock to higher levels but all this will happen in long term.

Also, we believe SBI Cards and Payment Services is another company to look into. It has the highest credit rating with AAA/stable rating (as per ICRA & Crisil). FIIs had increased stake from 3.53 percent (at the time of listing) to 4.03 percent (at the end of March), and DIIs to 3.04 percent from 1.6 percent. It is making up plans for special focus on online spends post lockdown. Generally, credit cardholders belong to educated, high rated and corporate clients having the capability to repay dues on time (especially for short term).

Thereby, a credit card holder would repay dues on priority rather than taking moratorium announced by RBI as one has to pay a huge interest of around 40-45 percent annually or 3-3.5 percent monthly. Instead, would prefer moratorium on term loans by banks or other financial institutions where the interest of 9-10 percent is being charged annually. Thus, it is quite clear that a good recovery for the credit card industry is expected.

Already, SBI Card has narrowed the borrowing limit. Therefore, altogether the risk of NPA for the credit card industry seems better than others. Though, the credit card industry is looking weak in the near term due to cautious discretionary spends, in the longer-term, as the businesses resume operations, we believe this industry will pick up pace.

Thus, SBI Card being the sole listed player in terms of the credit card industry with extensive credit card portfolio would regain strength.

However, the circumstances in which the stake was increased or decreased should be analyzed before making an investment decision, suggest experts.

One of the ways in which investors can make a buy or a sell decision is by analyzing what the promoter of the company is doing. Insider buying/selling by promoters/ promoter groups is on many occasions a lead indicator guiding investor decision making. Close LKP Securities has compiled Insider Data for the past 28 months beginning January 2018 so as to present few interesting insights in which there are 23 companies in which promoters have reduced stake, and there are over 60 companies in which promoters have raised stake in the same period. related news India in a Bear Market!

'US-China trade war noise likely to be high given US elections this year'

Investors lose Rs 36 lakh crore since Jan; experts say allocate 35-60% portfolio to equities There are as many as 66 companies in which promoters have raised stake since 2018. These include Bajaj Auto, GMR Infra, IDFC First Bank, JSW Steel, Sun Pharma, Tata Steel, Tata Power, and Tata Chemicals. An increase or decrease in promoter holding brings stocks under investors’ radar. Theory suggests that an increase in promoter holding is usually considered as a positive sign while a decrease is usually considered negative. However, the circumstances in which the stake was increased or decreased should be analyzed before making an investment decision, suggest experts. “When promoters raise stakes in companies like Tata Power at such low levels it provides confidence to investors who are rattled with the steep fall witnessed in the stock price of Tata Power,” S Ranganathan, Head of Research at LKP Securities told Moneycontrol. “Similarly, when SME companies like Sripipes witness promoter buying it tends to boost the confidence of investors. The buying seen in large groups like the Bajaj Group is also a pointer towards the confidence displayed by promoters in such times,” he said. Ranganathan further added that other factors that an Investor should keep in mind while pressing the ‘buy’ button after looking at promoter buying include capital allocation policies in the business which many times do not capture in return ratios.

Not all companies in which promoters raised stake are strong fresh buys, suggest experts. If you already hold them in their portfolio then you could hold on to them. The promoters increasing stake in their respective companies is an encouraging sign for the investor as it showcases confidence from the promoter in its business. But, it should not be the only criteria, and investors should use other parameters such as valuations and industry-specific factors before pressing the buy button. “Considering the current volatile scenario, we would recommend investors to gradually accumulate some of the prominent names like Bajaj Auto, HCL Tech, Asian Paints, Berger Paints, Dabur India, Tata Chemical, and Tata Steel,” Ajit Mishra, VP Research, Religare Broking Ltd told Moneycontrol. “Even though some of these companies are cyclical, we believe that with their strong fundamental track record, strong parentage, these companies would be able to wither the storm,” he said. Promoters reducing stake: There are as many as 23 companies excluding PSUs in which promoters have reduced stake since 2018 that include names like ZEE Entertainment, Wipro, M&M, Lux Industries, Emami, Axis Bank, and Bajaj Consumer Care etc. among others.

The promoter offloading its stake from his company is certainly not a good sign. However, there are various other reasons why promoters could have reduced the stake, and investors should not base their decision based on just one parameter. “There is no golden rule that investors need to reduce their holding as soon as the promoters cut stake. Since it could be due to regulatory requirements, deleverage, to bring in new investors, to raise capital, etc. which may be positive for the stocks,” Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told Moneycontrol. “So better look for reasons like pledging, funding issue of promoters or group and weak outlook which is very negative for the stock,” he said. Mishra of Religare Broking highlighted three scenarios under which promoters could raise the stake. In the first category, there are companies where promoter holding is greater than 75 percent thus they need to abide by the rules of bringing it to 75 percent levels and there is nothing to worry about. “However, in the second category, the promoter is selling a stake in companies such as Emami, Jyothy labs, Zee Entertainment, Lux Industries, Liberty shoes as there are facing high debt issues and the promoters have pledged their shares,” said Mishra. “And, lastly, there could be a case wherein the promoters are consistently reducing their stake. Investors should maintain extra caution with their existing investment in the companies which fall under category 2 and 3 and should try and reduce their investment as they tend to underperform the markets in the long run and also witness extreme volatility,” he explained.

In April so far, indices have gained 9 percent each, and if we include gains of last week of March, then the recovery is at 25 percent since the lockdown.

The rally is on the hopes of another round of stimulus package from the government, sharp fall in oil prices, and partial opening up of the economy in developed nations.

The upside is capped though as the number of cases of COVID-19 is still on the rise globally and domestically, experts feel.

""Given the sharp correction of over 30 percent in the last 2 months, markets have more than discounted the March quarter results.

Sumitomo Chemical: Buy | Target: Rs 280 | Return: 19.5 percent

""We expect the animal nutrition business along with CRAMS opportunity to change the business mix in the medium to long term. In turn, this could translate into an improvement in the operational performance. Further, ECC's expertise in active manufacturing should benefit SCI given the latter largely depends on imports of key molecules. Thus, a reduction in import and likely improvement in captive consumption should aid gross margins and thereby OPM. Given that no major capex is lined up in the coming future, the company should generate decent FCF in the years to come,"" said ICICI Direct which initiated coverage on the stock with a buy rating and arrived at a target price of Rs 280.

""Berger Paints is likely to report revenue, earnings CAGR of 11%, 32%, respectively, in FY19-22E supported by elevated margins (backed by benign raw material prices) and lower corporate tax. Further, with the dominance of limited players and intact long term growth drivers, the premium valuation of the company is justified due to its robust fundamentals (strong distribution, debt free status and consistent positive CFO),"" said ICICI Direct which initiated coverage on the stock with a buy rating and a target price of Rs 595.

Minda Industries: Buy | Target: Rs 300 | Return: 12.9 percent

""MIL is uniquely positioned in the domestic auto ancillary space as a provider of a wide variety of product solutions straddling established and growing opportunities.

""Kajaria Ceramics' (KJC) prudent capital allocation, strong focus on balance sheet strengthening and sharp eye on EBITDA margins will assist in maintaining its leadership position and gear up for strong leaps as business cycle reverses.

""Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (APSEZ) is rapidly consolidating its position with targeted investments and acquisitions aimed at expanding its hinterland coverage. APSEZ's front ended investments and strong partnerships have led to rapid cargo scale up with around 60 percent of the cargo being sticky,"" said Centrum Broking which initiated coverage on APSEZ with buy and a price target of Rs 390.

""While we expect 3.7 percent decline in cargo growth in FY21 for existing assets, we see APSEZ being well placed to capitalise on a likely growth recovery in FY22.

While Net Debt/EBITDA should expand to 3.9x in FY21 due to KPCL acquisition, we expect it to revert to 3.1x by FY22,"" it added.

Gujarat Pipavav Port: Buy | Target: Rs 72 | Return: 31.4 percent

""Gujarat Pipavav Port's (GPPL) container cargo growth has trailed industry due to loss of services caused by consolidation in the shipping industry. Realisations and margins meanwhile have sustained outside of impact of an adverse cargo mix. While we expect 8 percent decline in container cargo volumes in FY21 (13 percent growth in FY22 on a low base), cash flows should remain strong led by absence of debt or significant capex commitments,"" said Centrum Broking which initiated coverage with buy rating and DCF based price target of Rs 72 per share.

""The stock factors a prolonged growth slump with reverse DCF implying 0 percent CAGR in container cargo till September 2028 (end of the concession period – assuming no extension). GPPL’s strong credentials and historic dividend yield of 6.4 percent protects downside,"" it added.

We have collated a list of four factors which could be fuelling rally on D-Street:

Strong Global Cues:

Yes, Indian markets woke up to some strong gains seen on Wall Street, and a steady trend was seen in other Asian markets which could certainly have a rub-off effect on Indian markets as well.

Asian stocks rose to a fresh seven-week high. Japan's Nikkei, returning from a holiday on Wednesday, jumped 2 percent to a seven-week high as well.

Gilead's Remdesivir trial data lift sentiment:

US drug major Gilead Sciences on April 29 announced encouraging preliminary clinical trial data of its experimental antiviral drug Remdesivir that's been considered as a potential medication against novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, pandemic.

The study showed that 64.5 percent of the patients who received the shorter five days of treatment have recovered, compared with 53.8 percent of the group who were treated for 10 days.

The Remdesivir study is closely watched by medical experts and governments across the world as the pandemic had claimed the lives of around 2.2 lakh people. As of now, there are no approved medicines for COVID-19.

US Fed leaves rates near zero:

The U.S. Federal Reserve left interest rates near zero and gave no indication of lifting them any time soon. The US Fed chair Powell warns worst is ahead, vows continued support.

The U.S. economy suffered its sharpest decline in 11 years, with the first-quarter GDP contracting at a 4.8 percent quarterly annualized rate.

The U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday he is ready to invest more capital in new or expanded Federal Reserve coronavirus rescue lending programs but is not considering more aid to struggling airlines at the moment, said a Reuters report.

Mnuchin told reporters during a video news briefing that he was deliberately holding in reserve some $259 billion from the $2.2 trillion coronavirus rescue legislation passed in late March, it said.

Continuity of business activity:

The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said the government will be issuing new guidelines to fight the novel coronavirus pandemic and that the same will come into effect from May 4, a day after the second phase of national lockdown ends.

""Details regarding this shall be communicated in the days to come,"" MHA said. This could possibly mean that the government is looking at easing some of the restrictions.

23,"May 01, 2020 02:36 PM IST",Kshitij Anand,High rollover to May series on the back of low base; pharma stocks see long positions,"But, traders shouldn’t get carried away with high rollover figures, as that is mainly due to the low base of open interest (OI).
For the major part of the series, the Bank Nifty moved within the trading territory of the first five trading sessions of April series.
Rollover in the Bank Nifty stood at 81.59 percent, which is higher than the quarterly average of 64.10 percent.
From banking space, we witnessed long rollover in HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, and Federal Bank.
While stocks which added shorts and the same got rolled to the next series are PVR, Bajaj Finance, RBL Bank, Bank of Baroda, and Tata Power.",The up-move was supported by FIIs long positions in the derivatives segment as they continued to buy the index futures and also did a good amount of short covering.,"Jay Purohit

The Nifty50 started the April series on a negative note as we witnessed selling pressure towards 8,055 levels in the first week of the new series. However, it started rebounding from lower levels and rallied by more than 18 percent in the last four weeks.

Eventually, the Nifty50 concluded the April series with a gain of 14.1 percent, the biggest series-on-series gains after May 2009.

The index was light on positions after March derivatives expiry and added marginal longs in the recent upmove. However, most of the positions didn’t get rolled to the April series as open interest had decreased by 16.99 percent on an expiry-to-expiry basis.

Rollover stood at 71.29 percent, which is higher than its quarterly average of 68.69 percent. But, traders shouldn’t get carried away with high rollover figures, as that is mainly due to the low base of open interest (OI).

The volatility index (India VIX) has corrected by more than 50 percent since the March series and reached 34 levels. VIX is cooling down for the last five consecutive weeks, which provided some stability to bulls.

The upmove was supported by FIIs long positions in the derivatives segment as they continued to buy the index futures and also did a good amount of short covering.

As a result, their ‘Long Short Ratio’ in the index futures has moved from 27.41 percent to 64.43 percent. However, they remained net sellers in the cash market segment and cumulatively sold equities worth Rs 12,262 crore in April series.

At the same time, DIIs bought equities to the tune of Rs 8,005 crore. On the options front, open interest activity is scattered at 10,000, 9,500, and 11,000 Call options; while the highest Put OI is at 9,000, 8,500, and 8,000 strikes.

As of now, the index is light on positions and further build-up will decide the next trend in the market. Going forward, crucial support for the Nifty is placed at 9,000-8,800 zone; while a sustainable move above its hurdle of 10,200– 10,400 zone would be a challenge for bulls.

The Bank Nifty relatively underperformed the benchmark indices and ended the April series with gains of 9.79 percent over its March series close. For the major part of the series, the Bank Nifty moved within the trading territory of the first five trading sessions of April series.

We witnessed a good amount of long build-up in the recent upmove and most of these positions are still intact in the system as open interest increased by 20.82% on M-o-M basis.

Rollover in the Bank Nifty stood at 81.59 percent, which is higher than the quarterly average of 64.10 percent. Overall derivatives data of the Bank Nifty is relatively positive than the Nifty and thus, the ongoing bounce of banking index may continue towards 23,000 and then 24,500 zone.

While major support for the Bank Nifty is now placed at the 18,700–19,000 zone. From banking space, we witnessed long rollover in HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, and Federal Bank.

Since overall positions were on the lower side after March expiry, fresh build-up at the low base has resulted in a sharp increase in the change of open interest.

Out of 143 stocks from derivatives space, 116 counters witnessed rollover of more than 90 percent, which indicates decent positions get carried to the next series.

On stocks front, we witnessed a good amount of long rollovers in pharma space (Torrent Pharma, Lupin, Biocon, Cadila Healthcare, Glenmark, Cipla, Dr Reddys Lab) followed by other counters like Tata Chemicals, IGL, Manappuram, Hero MotoCorp, Bajaj Auto and Petronet.

While stocks which added shorts and the same got rolled to the next series are PVR, Bajaj Finance, RBL Bank, Bank of Baroda, and Tata Power.
