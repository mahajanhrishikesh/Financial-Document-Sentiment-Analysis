Edited excerpt:

Q) What would you advise – lump sum or staggered approach in direct equities or mutual funds?

A) Timing the market is not possible. However, at this juncture, it is better to have a staggered approach. The choice of stocks versus mutual funds is always an individual choice. I will advise buying the index fund right now.

Q) We have already seen a big casualty in the form of IndiaNivesh Securities broking arm shutting down the operations. Do you think this could just be the starting?

A) The broking industry will see more casualties in the near future.

Q) Where are the hotspots in terms of investment in the current scenario?

A) Right now the stock prices have no meaning as investors are trying to price their worst nightmares. So pinpointing what will go down because of the fundamental reason is futile.

Hotspot test is simple from now on (i.e. if markets fall further) higher the FII holding higher the correction.

Q) What is you take on the ESG sector? Could they turn out to be big winners once COVID-19 crisis is over?

A) It’s a fad and like all fad, it will also be over pretty soon. No company can survive which doesn’t care from its customers or employees. Social impact well that’s debatable.

I can argue that even carmakers are not ESG compliant (because they make a car which causes pollution) why to single out only tobacco or fossil fuel companies.

Q) With the starting of April we also start a new financial year – what are your expectations from the FY21? What are your views on earnings, markets, flows, as well as demand?

A) Excel extrapolation is a simple job and as an analyst, I am also forced to do it. However, as of now, no one knows what will be the earnings growth or decline.

One can pick any number as per one’s convenience. Market flows will remain muted until market recovers by 20 percent then we can start seeing some flows back to the market

Q) Once the lockdown is over and we (the whole world) come out of COVID-19 - what will be the new normal which the world will be looking at in investments, insurance, food habits, consumption etc.?

A) Human beings are extremely resilient and have the habit of forgetting the painful past. While for some months one may wear masks and maintain social distance; however, the fatigue of changing ingrained habits will be too much.

Moreover, please remember at worst, it will take 12-18 months for vaccine and then we will be back to basics in no time.

Q) We have seen massive wealth erosion in most of the top-quality stocks in FY20, and as we step into FY21 some of those names could give multibagger returns if someone is investing in them now. Could you highlight 3-5 such stocks that hold that potential?

A) Multi bagger we don’t know - getting 2X, 3x returns requires patience and a hell lot of it. For the next 12 months scenario we like large caps. Our picks are HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Britannia, PI Industries, Ultratech, and Siemens.

Q) Any particular sector(s) which investors should go underweight on at least for the next year or in the current FY?

A) May be where the mass gathering is required like malls cinema halls. What I mean here that one can be underweight sectors like Retail, airlines, etc.

As I said earlier for some months people will remain cautious and during that period P&L of many companies will take deep hit. Having said that, during the P&L hit these companies will give excellent buying opportunities.

In the current situation, investors can accumulate stocks from these sectors in a staggered manner for the long term.

edited excerpts:

A) It is a tough situation, not only for the Indian economy but for the markets across the globe. It’s different from earlier downturns as it is triggered by a pandemic and the exact impact or peak can’t be quantified yet.

However, this is also true that the market emerges much stronger and garners exceptional returns for those who utilise these corrections to accumulate quality companies with a long-term investment horizon.

Maybe a first-timer is still contemplating over his investment plan but a smart investor knows this well and will thus try to exploit this opportunity.

Now, coming to the choice of instrument or mode of investment, it is completely personal, depending on the risk profile of the individual.

In our opinion, it is an excellent time to build a long term portfolio as many fundamentally sound counters are available at a good bargain.

At the same time, you may let your mutual fund SIP running, to take advantage of averaging at lower levels. For those looking to build a fresh portfolio, we would suggest allocating 30-40 percent of their investable corpus at the current levels and wait for further correction or clarity over the market direction.

Q) We have already seen a big casualty in the form of IndiaNivesh Securities broking arm shutting down the operations. Do you think this could just be the starting?

Pharma, FMCG and private bank stocks are preferred bets while SIP in largecap funds and sectoral funds (beaten-down sectors such as Auto, Banks, and Oil & Gas) are advisable.

A) Undoubtedly, the current times are challenging and businesses across levels are feeling the heat. Profitability will get hit in these tough times and I am sure most businesses are searching for a way to stay afloat.

In line with the others, some of the brokerage firms, which were already in financial stress, are worst hit due to liquidity crunch after COVID -19 lockdown.

Q) A lot has been said about COVID-19 hotspots – but where are the hotspots in terms of investment in the current scenario?

But, I do not see the situation being so grim. We see most of the leading players are on course the journey of transformation and the lockdown period is only helping to cover the distance fast. However, consolidation in the industry is inevitable as there isn’t enough space for too many players.

A) Given the current situation, few essential consumer products and healthcare products are in high demand as it helps consumers to sail through difficult times. Both FMCG and healthcare sectors are hotspots wherein consistent buying is seen amid coronavirus scare.

We believe these two defensive sectors are safe bets in such volatile markets. Although these sectors are also facing challenges due to lockdown wherein factories are either closed or working with less manpower and supply chains have been hit.

Q) What is your take on the ESG sector? Do you think companies in the ESG space could get attention?

However, once things begin to recover, there is a likelihood that these sectors would witness a stronger demand for essential items. In the current situation, investors can accumulate stocks from these sectors in a staggered manner for the long term.

A) The ESG space companies take into account the non-financial performance indicators that include environmental, social and corporate governance factors.

These parameters are usually used by socially conscious investors to screen securities to invest. It may offer a potential long-term performance advantage when integrated into investment analysis and portfolio construction.

Q) What is your expectations from the FY21? What are your views on earnings, markets, flows, as well as demand?

In India, the ESG based investing is not as big as compared to some of the developed countries. And, companies following the ESG matrix would also face the brunt of a slowdown and that would impact their earnings trajectory. However, their recovery could be comparatively stronger once we see the revival of the economy.

A) We do not expect a very promising start for FY21 as we are still grappling with the pandemic which has hit economic activity across the globe. We believe Q1 of FY21E will be majorly impacted by the nationwide lockdown, which will lead to earnings downgrade for most of the companies.

Also, FIIs may continue to be net sellers if the situation does not improve in the coming days. Adding to the worries, if the virus spread intensifies further or continues for longer than excepted, it could also induce redemption pressure and that in turn would trigger selling from the DIIs as well.

Nevertheless, Nifty P/E now hovers around its historical average, which provides a good investment opportunity and the past trend suggests that every major fall is followed by a strong rebound in the markets.

Q) In the post-COVID-19 world, what will be the new normal which the world will be looking at in investments, insurance, food habits, consumption, etc.?

Hence, as and when the coronavirus cases start receding, we could see a gradual recovery in demand and pick up in the economy, which would lead to an increase in fund flows to the markets.

A) We may see investors taking the concept of valuation more seriously and plan their future investments accordingly. Also, they might have realised by now the importance of having defensive stocks in their portfolio as a hedge, to sail through the tough time.

Further, the unexpected rise in cases of coronavirus only reinstates the fact that insurance is a necessity and not a discretionary spend and therefore we could see an increase in insurance penetration in India.

Additionally, the consumption would pick up. However, it would be gradual especially for discretionary goods and services.

Q) We have seen massive wealth erosion in most of the top-quality stocks in FY20, and as we step into FY21 some of those names could give multibagger returns if someone is investing in them now. Could you highlight 3-5 such stocks that hold that potential?

A) The Indian markets have corrected sharply from their peaks and we have seen massive wealth erosion in most of the top-quality stocks as growth and earnings for FY21E are expected to get adversely impacted.

Also, with a change in the market dynamics, we could see a change in the sectoral allocation by the fund managers to stay relevant.

Amid all, we believe there are quite a few top names that are trading either close to or below their historical average P/E and provide a margin of safety at current levels.

We recommend accumulating stocks like ICICI Bank, Hindustan Unilever (HUL), Cipla, Reliance Industries and HDFC Life Insurance gradually for healthy long term gains.

Q) Any particular sector(s) which investors should go underweight on at least for the next year or in the current FY?

A) Among the sectors, PSU Banking, metal, realty and auto are affected more by the virus-led economic disruption and thus recovery in these sectors will be gradual.

We would advise investors to stay away from these sectors (at least for the next 2 quarters) or take selective bets until there are meaningful signs of revival.

On the flip side, we are overweight on FMCG, pharma and selective names in private banking as they are already witnessing buying interest or showing resilience at the higher levels and would rebound faster once the economy recovers.

Based on the recommendations of some analysts, here are 15 mid-cap stocks that you may consider for a one-year horizon. Take a look:

Analyst: Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services

Jubilant Foodworks | Buy | LTP: Rs 1,421.20 | Target price: Rs 1,674 | Upside: 18%

Jubilant Foodworks is a leading quick-service restaurant company with strong revenue growth of 27 percent CAGR for the last 9 years.

In the current scenario, with earnings impact already factored in the price, the valuation looks very attractive. Jubilant has a free cash flow of Rs 244 crore as of FY19.

""With no leverage and adequate cash balance of Rs 596 crore, Jubilant is well placed to meet its operational challenges. We maintain buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,674 based on 45 times FY21E adjusted EPS,"" said the analyst.

Escorts | Buy | LTP: Rs 690.40 | Target price: Rs 820 | Upside: 19%

Escorts is the third-largest agricultural tractor manufacturer in India having strong presence in north India.

The near-term headwinds is unlikely to impact Indian farmers flow of activities while strong Rabi season and 1.7 lakh crore interim stimulus package for farmers will signal positive for the company.

The joint venture with KUBOTA, a global leader in tractor, will lead to higher global footprint .

""Given the company’s growth outlook and strong balance sheet we value Escorts at 19 times FY21 EPS and recommend buy with a target of Rs 820,"" said the analyst.

Mahanagar Gas | Buy | LTP: Rs 901 | Target price: Rs 1,083 | Upside: 20%

Mahanagar Gas is Mumbai's sole distributor of gas, an essential commodity, the demand for which will not be impacted much by the present COVID-19 scenario.

The recent decline in natural gas prices will lower costs and expand margins going forward. The demand for gas is set to pick up drastically in the country, with the government encouraging the use of clean fuels and reduce pollution levels in the country.

Bharat Electronics | Buy | LTP: Rs 70.15 | Target price: Rs 90 | Upside: 28%

Bharat Electronics is well-positioned to benefit from rising defence expenditure, given its technological superiority (in-house R&D spend nearly 10 percent of revenues) and strong execution capabilities and GoI focus on indigenous procurement.

COVID is not going to impact defense spending, while strong execution and dividend yield of 5.4 percent makes it attractive.

Current order backlog is at Rs 54,959 crore (4.5 times FY19 sales), provides strong earning visibility for the next 3 years.

Currently the stock is trading at 1 year forward at P/E of 8 times which 38 percent discount of historical average of 13 times.

""Given strong balance sheet, RoE nearly 20 percent and strong earnings visibility, we have a buy rating with a target price of Rs 90,"" said the analyst.

Analyst: Shrikant Chouhan, Executive Vice President, Equity Technical Research at Kotak Securities

Manappuram Finance | Buy | LTP: Rs 111.30 | Target price: Rs 140 | Stop loss: Rs 90 | Upside: 26%

A) Last week assured investors that by investing on every dip they can earn better returns in the short to medium-term. The factors that have lead to a sharp rally are stimulus hopes and COVID-19 cases going down across the globe.

If our government fails to fulfil expectations on the stimulus side and COVID-19 cases continue to increase then it would be a double whammy. Investors should be cautiously optimistic from here onwards.

Q) What are the factors which investors should watch out for in the coming week, which is again be truncated one?

A) Even if it is a spoiler for the economy, India should not compromise while tackling with coronavirus.

The world is watching India as to how it is going to deal with the coronavirus crisis. It is the real testing time for India and if we can save ourselves from this crisis, there will be a huge foreign direct investment flow in India in the coming days.

The most important thing is strong control over the spread of coronavirus. Stocks and sectors have stabilised, the market will soon start trading in a range.

A) Currently, largecap stocks are available at comparatively cheaper valuations. Then why does anyone need to run behind small and midcap stocks?

Q) We cannot close our eyes to is ""recession"" as well as COVID – 19 outbreak. Both the events are interlinked and will have long-lasting damage to the economies across the world including India. What are your views?

A) I believe in the theory of ""the market discounts lots of things well in advance"". Of course, we cannot close our eyes to recession as well as COVID-19 outbreak but at the same time, we cannot forget that one or the other sector takes the leadership and that helps move the market higher. Our focus should be on recession-proof sectors.

A) Defensives are likely to hog the limelight. From 2009 to 2015, we saw a V-shaped rally in pharmaceuticals, technology, and FMCG stocks.

If India does well in terms of handling the outbreak then the FIIs flows will increase for the top five companies of Nifty 50.

We should increase our exposure to telecom companies. Internet data is one of the most essential commodities in the current times it would be playing a big role.

A) We should focus on following stocks for the coming week with a positional view of buy -- Reliance Industries, Cipla, ICICI Bank, Infosys, HDFC Bank, ITC and Escorts.

Weekly returns on both Nifty and Bank Nifty were in double digits, 12% and 15% respectively.
There was 8% long interest addition for Nifty which basically all the addition that came in on the last session of the week.

Which reminds of the fact that any complacency derived from this up move could turn completely misleading just in a session’s time.,"Shubham Agarwal

The only good news amid the ongoing crisis led by COVID-19 was the way equities behaved this week across the globe. Our own Nifty was no different where after a big dent in past few weeks finally there was a respite that did not get sold into.

For the week both Nifty and Bank Nifty got a lot of traction and despite of the long weekend the indices held on to their gains. Weekly returns on both Nifty and Bank Nifty were in double digits, 12% and 15% respectively.

On the open interest front in futures though there was anomaly in the activity in both indices. There was 8% long interest addition for Nifty which basically all the addition that came in on the last session of the week. Bank Nifty however, added 15% interest for the week, half of it was contributed by longs and half by the shorts created in the beginning of the week.

Aggregate futures OI did not see similar augmentation in the total OI, mainly due to the force of depleting OI by short covering. None the less the highlight of the week remains the secular rise as amid this turmoil this week will go down in history for having not a single stock with weekly loss to record.

One more positive this week was the share of fresh interest. Around 57% stocks added long interest, while the rest covered shorts.

Dicing the stock futures OI sector wise two notables are very clear, one that the short-covering sectors remain limited and secondly while the Price gain is phenomenal, OI gain is fairly limited.

Among short-covering sectors metal had secular short-covering except for Vedanta and led by Jindal Steel. In long interest additions, on the other hand, Capital Goods led by Voltas, L&T, BHEL, and Banking led by HDFC Bank, Bank of Baroda, Canara Bank were major recipients.

Coming down to the options arena, the implied volatility still remains high and so does the size of daily swings. This has taken its toll on the available liquidity. Option participants remain afraid and away especially from stock options.

As far as index options are concerned, the rise has definitely positively impacted the composition and pushed out a lot of call writers and invited fresh Put writers. This, in turn, has raised the OI PCR fairly higher to an almost upper extreme.

Sentimentally, the only characteristic of the F&O market that remains reminiscent of the turmoil is the very level of implied volatility. Which reminds of the fact that any complacency derived from this up move could turn completely misleading just in a session’s time.

Being hedged at all times is quintessential accounting for a hedge cost in each and every trade hence, weekly hedge in Nifty is advised via Modified Butterfly.

Modified Put Butterfly is a 4-legged strategy where 1 lot of Put close to current underlying level is bought against that 2 lots of lower strike Puts are sold and 1 more lot of Put is bought but closer to the Put sold strike. This keeps the lower but constant profits in case of a downward breakout. This is a fairly risk-averse and a universal strategy.

Edited excerpts:

Q) It was comparatively a better week for Indian markets but what is the way forward? What are the reasons for the rally – stimulus hopes, a drop in coronavirus cases?

A) Indian markets are aping the US and other global indices, as there is a revival in confidence with regards to fighting this pandemic. Many countries are showing a reduction in COVID-19-related cases and this is boosting sentiment.

Another factor that led to the rally this week was the fact that the lockdown period is coming to an end. Whether this period will be extended is anybody’s guess, but for now, investors’ hopes are up that most of the negatives are already factored in.

Q) What are the factors that investors should watch out for in the coming week, which again will be a truncated one? Initial reports suggest that the lockdown will be extended in the metros, will that be a spoiler?

A) Investors are hawk-eyed to the news on the extension of the lockdown. This will be the deciding factor that will guide bourses in the coming week.

Any surprises will cause the indices to move either with a gap-up or a gap-down. Global cues will also be a major force for the markets in the coming week. Traders should be extremely cautious and take bets only if they have a high-risk appetite.

Q) Small & midcaps have outperformed. Is it value buying which is leading to the outperformance or the liquidity factor, which is not enough in some of these names when compared to largecaps?

A) Buying is more event-driven at this point than value-driven. Investors are following the ‘buy-on-dips’ strategy but in the process, they are forgetting that companies that have performed in the past are not necessarily going to emerge winners post this pandemic.

It is extremely essential to analyse the impact of lockdowns and restrictions in trade on businesses before buying them.

Since there is uncertainty in how long the lockdown will last or if it will be extended, it is too early to assess the gravity of the crisis.

Q) One thing which we cannot close our eyes to is “recession” and the coronavirus outbreak. Both the events are interlinked and will have a lasting impact on the economies across the world, including India. What are your views?

A) Markets and the economy, in general, have witnessed recessions once every decade. It is indeed a tough time as this pandemic is not due to a financial crisis but is a health hazard.

Hence, the impact will be much larger, affecting varied industries. Recessions are tough times with job losses, shut down in small businesses and the steeper the fall, the longer time it will take for economies to revive just like it has in the past.

Q) Which are the companies that are likely to see a V-shaped recovery after the lockdown?

Hence, only risk-taking investors who have the patience to remain invested for a good five years should start accumulating equities. It will not be advisable for the faint-hearted to venture into the market when the VIX is at 51 while the lower range is 30.

A) A V-shaped recovery in stock prices can be witnessed in most beaten-down stocks and sectors. Auto, auto ancillaries, NBFCs, private banks, and metals will witness recovery as the pent-up demand is likely to compensate for the lost days.

There may be a postponement in demand but nonetheless demand will remain for such companies. FMCG, as a sector, will not be attractive from investing point of view because of high valuations and the fact that a bullish consensus is already built into prices.

We are in unprecedented times. Nobody in January would have imagined a complete lockdown of the world for an uncertain period of time along with such massive destruction of wealth. That’s what life is all about.

Risk means more things can happen than will happen. Currently, the world is grappling with these questions:

Q) How long and serious the COVID-19 spread can get; will it get worse before it gets better?

Q) How the lockdown will impact the businesses and economies structurally?

While answers to many of these questions are uncertain and will evolve with each passing day, one thing we believe is that the spread happened at a time when everyone was caught off guard.

Now that it’s a full-blown crisis, Governments and organizations around the globe have come out with full might to curtail the spread and find a cure.

And, it will be a matter of limited time before which it will either get curtailed through a cure or a pause in the spread of new cases or a combination of both.

We would assign a 50-60 percent probability to the world slowly opening up in May/June 2020 and India can even open earlier too. But, never forget the balance probability, so one has to be watching & agile to the evolving situation.

How will business and economies get impacted?

Currently, there are two risks that businesses are facing – productivity loss and liquidity crunch, with the latter one being far more detrimental! We believe companies with good balance sheets and flexible cost structures will be able to navigate through.

The RBI and Government will take counter-cyclical measures to support either specific industries or general businesses to tide over the liquidity squeeze.

But one can never be sure of the effectiveness of these measures, hence businesses with leverage and high fixed costs will be at high risk and will have to tread cautiously.

Our view on the markets - is it a good time to invest?

Very often, we get this question about how much more downside is left? Truthfully, the answer to this is known by none.

Nifty has bounced by more than 1,000 points and has managed to close above crucial resistance and swing high of 9,040. The weekly candlestick has formed a bullish pattern by closing above the last three weeks high (9,040) and now it can trade towards previous swing high standing around 9,600 mark.

Nifty is forming ‘ABCD’ harmonic pattern and currently, its ‘D’ leg is in progress which can either be equal to ‘A’ leg which comes to 9,600 marks or it can extend to 1.618 of ‘A’ which is near 10,000 marks suggesting index can trade higher with positive sentiments towards pattern targets.

Also, the index has given a breakout of inverse head and shoulders pattern on a lower time frame by giving decisive close above 9000 levels and target as this pattern is also around 9,600 levels.

Furthermore, the benchmark index has managed to close above important moving averages 5 DMA (8,600) and 20 DMA (8,720) suggests one should opt for buy on the dip. On a flip side, a decisive close below strong psychological levels of 8,500 can push index towards crucial support and line of parity standing around 7,800 marks.

Banking Index has managed to close around crucial psychological levels of 20,000 and 5 day’s highest high is suggesting a reversal of short term trend and relief rally towards 25,000 levels cannot be ruled out, conversely, any decisive trading below 18,500 will be a sign of active bears.

Trade Recommendation

Tata Motors | Rating: Buy around Rs 73 | Target: Rs 85 | Stop Loss: Rs 66 | Upside: 13 percent

It has formed a double bottom pattern on the daily chart, which should resolve on the upside after its brief consolidation. The momentum oscillator RSI is in positive territory and entering into a trending phase.

The MACD too indicates good momentum-trend follow through. We recommend buying Tata Motors around Rs 73 with a stop loss of Rs 66 and a target price of Rs 85.

HCL Technologies | Rating: Buy around Rs 458 |Target: Rs 528 | Stop Loss: Rs 428 | Upside: 12 percent

IT as a sector is expected to outperform in the current scenario. Weaken strength in rupee against the dollar could also help this sector to remain strong in the coming week. Recently, the stock gave double bottom breakout and still consolidating above the neckline of the breakout suggest upside move will continue in the near term also.

The momentum oscillator also exited the oversold zone on the daily chart. We recommend buying HCL Tech around Rs 468 keeping a stop loss of Rs 428, for the target of Rs 528.

Just Dial | Rating: Buy around Rs 318 | Target: Rs 350| Stop Loss: Rs 298 | Upside: 10 percent

After hitting the peak of RS 623, the stock gave a sharp fall towards till Rs 250-260 zone from where the chances of developing demand are higher. As of now, the appearance of bullish Harami on the daily chart is giving cues to accumulate this stock at lower levels. The momentum oscillator RSI which is currently overbought took a turn on the north side.

As long as it sustains above the mentioned zone, the possibility of moving on the upside is higher and it can hit our target with ease. We suggest buying Just Dial around Rs 318 with the stop loss of Rs 298 and target Rs 350.

In order to keep coronavirus infections under check, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced a pan-India lockdown for 21 days on March 24, effective 00:00 hours on March 25.

Since March 25, there were a total of 10 trading sessions. Out of 10, the benchmarks ended in the green in 5 sessions.

While Nifty is back above 9,000-mark, Sensex, too, has reclaimed 31,000 level.

This may offer some relief even though Sensex and Nifty are still 26 percent down from their all-time highs of 42,273.87 and 12,430.50, respectively, that they had hit in January 2020.

Amid all the uncertainty in the market, the recent correction in the market has been termed as an investment opportunity by most experts and brokerages.

In the BSE 500 index, as many as 437 stocks logged gains. Out of 437, 16 stocks surged over 50 percent since March 24. As many as 337 stocks jumped more than 10 percent in that period.

Among the sectoral indices on BSE, Healthcare emerged as the top gainer, jumping as much as 29 percent during that period.

BSE Energy, Oil & Gas, FMCG and Telecom logged gains of 26 percent, 23.59 percent, 21.64 percent and 20.36 percent, respectively, during the period of lockdown so far. BSE IT, with a gain of 6.45 percent, remained at the end of the sectoral indices.

Will the rally sustain?

The market is in uncertain territory. Unless the issue of COVID-19 comes under control, the market will continue to experience bouts of volatility.

Experts are of the view that such intermittent rally is a trading rally in a bear market which may not be sustainable.

""This uptrend seems to be a short-term bear market rally and may not be sustainable,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.

Nair added that there is an expectation that the worst affected sectors and MSMEs may get some relief in another package to be announced shortly by the government. Markets will continue to fluctuate based on news coming out regarding the spread of infections and any lifting of lockdown in India.

Not much has changed for the market and there is very little for it to cheer.

The real picture of the economy is worrysome and it cannot be said how long it will take to get the economy on track.

Singapore's banking group DBS has revised the country's GDP estimate to 1.5 percent for the current fiscal amid the current lockdown due to COVID-19. This comes a day after American brokerage Goldman Sachs revised its forecast for the country's real GDP growth to 1.6 percent as against 3.3 percent it had estimated earlier.

India's industrial output grew at 4.5 percent as against a 0.2 percent growth rate year-on-year, as per the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) data released by the government on April 9.

But experts are of the view that this will deteriorate sharply due to the lockdown.

""There is not much to cheer from this data as IIP growth is likely to sharply fall going forward due to the impact of COVID-19 crisis. Even after the lockdown is lifted, demand for consumer discretionary items will take time to recover given the poor consumer sentiments in midst of job losses and pay cuts. Capital goods demand will also remain weak as businesses will be wary of capex in these uncertain times,” said Rajani Sinha, Chief Economist & Head Research at Knight Frank India.

The hopes are pinned on the economic stimulus that the government may bring in the coming days. The stimulus announced in the past were not enough to meet the need of the economy, experts said.

Nifty made a sharp comeback on the back of positive global cues to form higher double bottoms on weekly charts. It closed the week ended April 9 near the high of the week.

The index closed in positive after seven consecutive weeks of fall with a broad-based positive momentum across sectors and stocks.

As the index is almost 21 percent up from its 52 week low, it confirms a strong bottom is in place and any fall near 8,650 levels would be a good opportunity to create longs in the index.

Among individual sectors, pharma, FMCG, private banks and auto indices have gained 41 percent, 28 percent, 26 percent and 25 percent, respectively, from their 52-week lows, outperforming the headline index Nifty50.

High beta sectors like metal, media have gained traction along with the broader markets to gain in the range of 13-15 percent from their lows.

India VIX declined 43 percent from its all-time high to close at 50 levels.

We believe now Nifty will try to consolidate and witness some weakness from higher levels of 9,500-9,600.

One should note that midcaps and smallcaps have underperformed by a large margin during the current rally and may witness a good amount of action over the next few trading sessions.

The full-year results for FY20 would start trickling from the next week and one can expect individual stock-wise momentum depending on the results and outlook of the management for the next year after the pandemic crisis of COVID-19.

Bank Nifty has resistance near 20,600 at its short-term moving average and recent high crossover of the same would witness an extended move to 21,800 levels. On the downside, support is placed at 18,800-19,100 levels.

Here are three stock recommendations for the next 3-4 weeks:

ACC | Buy | LTP: Rs 1,007.70 | Target price: Rs 1,150 | Stop loss: Rs 915 | Upside: 14%

The stock has been trading in a range, holding its support levels of Rs 900 and has made higher bottoms on the weekly charts.

Crossover of its short-term 20-day average will give a breakout and week-on-week positive close reinforces our positive stance.

On the downside, multiple supports exist in the range of Rs 930-950 levels, protecting the downside from the current levels.

Eicher Motors | Buy | LTP: 13,700 | Target price: Rs 16,700 | Stop loss: Rs 12,300 | Upside: 22%

The stock has found support near Rs 12,500, which is exactly the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement from its all-time high of Rs 33,480.

The sector is witnessing positive momentum and the stock has witnessed a sharp up move in the current week and we believe bottoms are in place for a strong up move.

The key technical indicators such as RSI has also reversed, turning upwards. The stock looks poised for a breakout from the current levels.

Dabur India | Sell | LTP: Rs 483.55 | Target price: Rs 445 | Stop loss: Rs 530 | Downside: 8%

The stock failed to cross its 52-week high and made a lower top witnessing a sharp correction from higher levels with strong volumes.

Overbought RSI and a decline in price are also signalling weakness in the stock.

On the higher side, the stock will face major hurdle around Rs 520-525, its recent high connecting the average rising trend line.

Short position can be initiated in the range of Rs 495-505 for a target of Rs 445 with a stop loss of Rs 530.

ICRA revised ratings on term loans to 'ICRA AA-' from 'ICRA AA'. The outlook was revised to 'stable' from 'negative'.

The rating downgrade factors in the weakening cost competitiveness of NFL in urea operations, arising from a sharp rise in energy consumption in the current fiscal, which was brought about by unscheduled plant outages, ICRA said in a note.

Besides, production of urea beyond RAC was also less remunerative in a scenario of subdued international prices, which impacted its cash accruals.

With tightening of energy norms by the government from FY2021, NFL’s cash accruals would further take a hit, even though the company was embarking on an energy-saving project that would partially mitigate the risk, ICRA said.

The downgrade in rating also factors the weakening credit metrics of the company due to elevated debt, brought about by higher subsidy receivables and increase in the scale of trading operations leading to higher working capital borrowings and large debt-funded capital expenditure, and investments in the Joint venture company, Ramagundam Fertilisers & Chemicals Limited (RFCL), ICRA added.

Edited excerpt:

A) On April 9, the Nifty50 closed with an uptick of 363.16 points or 4.15 percent and on a weekly basis, it surged up by about 12 percent.

The benchmark indices ended with a positive note with an expectation of stimulus package from the government. The number of COVID-19 cases in India is low compare to the other nations like US and European countries like Italy, Spain where the number of deaths is in thousands as compared to the hundreds in India.

Although the government has announced various relief measures to save the economy, investors are still expecting a second stimulus package from the government which might be focused on MSMEs which is the worst hit.

Q) What are the factors which investors should watch out for in the coming week, which is again be truncated one?

A) The measures taken by the government are highly appreciated, especially the decision on lockdown of the entire country for 21 days. Many states in India have already expressed their views on expanding the lockdown until April 30.

While the number of cases in India is now getting steeper and lockdown is the only solution to prevent the widespread of the virus. Going forward, any extension of the lockdown, especially in the hotspot areas, with the objective of containing the virus, might be a positive sign to the market.

On a weekly basis Rupee is making a fresh low due to uncertainty over COVID-19 cases and it difficult to identify the bottom.

Although the market remaining under pressure, the decline in India VIX suggests some consolidation is expected around 9,000 levels. Resistance for Nifty is placed at 9,200 and 9500 levels while support is now placed at 9,000 and 8,700 levels.

Q) Small & Midcaps outperform - is it value buying which is leading to outperformance or the liquidity factors which is not enough in some of these names as compared to large caps?

A) Most of the investors are in the dilemma of whether markets have already bottomed out or would bottom out in the next few months. Frankly speaking, no one would have any idea but due to the sharp fall of the market, many investors would find it attractive to invest in small and mid-cap.

Many believe that the small & mid-cap companies may not survive after this pandemic. The complete shutdown of the business has led to high fixed costs, high working capital, and low liquidity, etc. but one has to identify the value buying which results in high-risk reward as compared to the large caps.

Investors would have to invest for the long term to know the true potential of the small and mid-caps.

Q) One thing which we cannot close our eyes to is ‘recession’ is as well as COVID – 19 outbreak. Both the events are interlinked and will have long-lasting damage to the economies across the world including India. What are your views?

A) The global economy is expected to tip into recession in 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic has affected global production, supply chains, trade, and tourism.

The reduction in international crude oil prices, if sustained, can improve India’s terms of trade, but these gains are not expected to offset the drag from the shutdown and loss of external demand.

However, domestic growth would depend on the speed with which the outbreak is contained, and the pace at which economic activity returns to normalcy.

Q) Which are the companies that are likely to see a V – shaped recovery after the lockdown?

A) It is expected to see a V-shaped recovery in stocks like Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited, CEAT Limited, Avenue Supermarts Limited, Havells India Limited, ICICI Bank Limited, Jubilant Foodworks Limited, Mahindra & Mahindra Limited as most of these stocks are trading below their 100 DEMA and 200 DEMA.

Technically, the above-mentioned stocks are indicating reversal patterns in their daily charts. Since these stocks are fundamentally sound and are available at attractive valuations, they are likely to grab investors’ attention in the near future.

Q) Any technical trading ideas which investors can look at for the coming week?

A) Volatility is expected to remain high in the upcoming week as well. However, it can be observed that most of the stocks have recovered significantly in the past few trading sessions.

So, investors should be investing in selective stocks considering the volatility in specific sectors as well as financials of the stocks they are going to invest in.

However, ‘Buy at dip’ would be advised by keeping a close watch on the movement of currency and crude oil prices as well as the movement of international markets.

The highly contagious virus has taken a huge toll on most sectors, but pharma companies have withstood the carnage, with some stocks delivering healthy returns.

Experts say that the pharma and healthcare sectors have a crucial role in supporting the government and people and are doing a great job by managing medicine supplies as demand remains strong.

The BSE Healthcare index has closed in the green in the last four consecutive sessions. BSE Healthcare has emerged as the top gainer among sectoral indices, jumping 29 percent since March 25, the day the three-week lockdown began.

Pharma, as a sector, has emerged a strong contender to drive the next leg of the rally. In anticipation, pharma stocks have seen a huge run-up in the last few days.

Since February 1, the BSE Healthcare index is 4 percent up against a 23 percent fall in the Sensex, as of April 9 close, data from Ace Equity shows.

Shares of IOL Chemicals & Pharmaceuticals, Abbott India, Torrent Pharmaceuticals, Cadila Healthcare and Cipla have surged up to 44 percent since February 1.

However, shares of Take Solutions, Shalby, Jubilant Life Sciences, Aster DM Healthcare and Piramal Enterprises have cracked up to 50 percent during the period.

The road ahead

Brokerages say the 21-day lockdown has sprung several unprecedented challenges for the sector such as lower employee attendance, logistic problems and a shortage of accessories like packaging and labelling material. These have led to lower capacity utilisation at most plants.

The sector, however, is well-positioned to endure the coronavirus pain, brokerages say.

""In pharma, barring few supply-related disturbances, we do not envisage material earnings impact in FY21. Also, note that in this unprecedented global lockdown, pharma and healthcare services, being at the top layer of essential services, remain exempted everywhere,"" said brokerage firm ICICI Direct.

HDFC Securities has a positive view on the sector, too. The brokerage says its positive stance on Indian pharma is premised on sector’s relative resilience to coronavirus disruption, favourable currency tailwinds and stable outlook for India and the US business.

HDFC forecasts 11 percent growth for its covered companies over the next two years. However, the brokerage identifies extended lockdown as a risk, as it can impact demand and manufacturing.

Moreover, a delay in key approvals, delay in the USFDA plant resolution due to travel advisory, EM markets currency risks and subdued demand are seen as the key risks for the sector.

Stocks to consider

Brokerages say while in the short term most companies will bounce back from the last five years of underperformance, this time around, the leader will be different. Hence, one needs to choose stocks carefully.

Edelweiss Broking suggests following five stocks:

Ajanta Pharma

Edelweiss sees Ajanta Pharma as a turnaround story. The brokerage expects the company's margin to improve to 31 percent by FY22 from 27 percent in FY19.

It expects FY20/21/22 EPS of Rs 53/70/83, respectively. At its April 8 closing price of Rs 1,367.5, the stock trades at 23/19/16 times FY20/21/22E P/E and FY22E RoCE of 20 percent.

Degrowth in the Africa business is a point of worry but Edelweiss is quite comfortable with Ajanta's US and India numbers. ""We expect Africa to grow by 12 percent over the next two years,"" Edelweiss said.

Abbott India

Edelweiss sees it as a CAGR story. The brokerage highlighted that Abbott India has seen strong sales growth (organic: 15 percent CAGR; inorganic: 18 percent) in the last 10 years compared to an average 11 percent growth by other Indian pharmaceutical players.

This has been driven by strong execution and acquisition of Piramal Healthcare’s domestic formulation business in May 2010, Edelweiss said.

The brokerage expects FY20/21/22E EPS of Rs 313/360/416. At its April 8 closing price of Rs 17,481, the stock trades at 56/49/42 times FY20/FY21/FY22E P/E and FY22E RoCE of 23 percent.

""The Indian government periodically issues a price cap on certain essential drugs. About 40 percent of Abbott’s portfolio falls under Drug Price Control Orders (DPCO), so any incremental coverage would pose a risk to earnings,"" Edelweiss said.

Dr Reddy’s Laboratories

It is 'new management, new story' theme for Edelweiss as India business is a key focus for the company now.

Edelweiss highlights that despite its strong innovation capabilities since inception, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories is not even among the top 10 domestic formulation players. Its India business was never a focus area for the management, which led to market share loss over a period of time.

""But for the new management, India will be a key focus area. It recently acquired a large portfolio from a competitor,"" Edelweiss said.

The brokerage expects FY20/21/FY22 EPS of Rs 120/150/174. At its April 8 closing price of Rs 3,683, the stock trades at 31/25/22 times FY20/21/22E P/E and FY22E RoCE of 20 percent.

Any delay in gCopaxone launch can impact FY22E earnings of the company significantly, said Edelweiss. Also, any USFDA issue with its Bachupally facility is a risk.

Laurus Labs

Edelweiss sees the company as a classic investment story.

The brokerage thinks the earnings of the company will shoot up to Rs 34 per share in FY21E from Rs 9 per share in FY19.

The stock trades at 12 times FY21E P/E. RoCE is seen improving to 13 percent in FY21E from 6 percent in FY19.

Edelweiss expects FY20/21/22 EPS of Rs 24/34/37. At its April 8 closing price of Rs 391, the stock trades at 17/12/11 times FY20/21/22E P/E and FY22E RoCE of 14 percent.

The brokerage said its margin assumption for FY21/22 is 22 percent but any pricing pressure in API/formulation can impact EPS significantly.

Biocon

It is a participant of mega theme -- biosimilar and TINA, said Edelweiss.

Edelweiss points out that the total biosimilar market size was pegged at $20 billion in 2019 by various studies. The same is expected to touch $60 billion by 2025, the highest growth category for pharma companies globally.

The brokerage is of the view that Biocon has proven its mettle by launching Pegfilgrastim ($4 billion) in the US last year. In March, it received approval for Lantus ($6 billion).

The brokerage expects FY20/21/22 EPS of Rs 7.5/10.2/13.4. At its April 8 closing price of Rs 327, the stock trade at 43/32/24 times FY20/21/22E P/E and FY22E RoCE of 12 percent.

Any facility-related USFDA action is a risk for the stock.

The Cup & Handle pattern is believed to be one of the most reliable and popular patterns among traders community. In technical analysis, a Cup & Handle pattern describes a specific chart formation that projects a bearish-to-bullish trend reversal. A Cup & Handle reversal pattern forms after a down trend, and its completion marks a trend reversal to up trend.

In the standard Cup & Handle pattern, we connect the high after Cup with the high created after the handle. A trend line is drawn by connecting these highest points of the two peaks, which is called as “Neckline"". This trend line is the most important component of C & H pattern.

Why to buy Amara Raja Batteries?

C&H patterns are an integral part of technical analysis, but successful traders combine these techniques with technical indicators and other forms of technical analysis to maximize their odds of success.

Amara Raja has recently crossed the strong resistance line standing around Rs 490 levels indicating strong bullish breakout. Recent formation of cup and Handle pattern breakout on a close above Rs 490 marks suggests buying in the stock for higher targets of Rs 590. Decent volume participation while giving breakout is also giving support to C&H pattern.

Cup & Handle pattern and Buy signal on Amara Raja Batteries

Buy Signal:

> A close above neckline (490) of Cup & Handle pattern is indicating trend reversal to uptrend.> Short- term moving average 20 DMA (490) defines short-term trend is providing support to buyers as prices are sustained and trading around it.> Mid- term moving average 50 DMA (455) defines mid-term trend is very well augur with bulls as prices are sustained and trading above it.

> Decent volume participation while pattern breakout will also give additional confirmation.

Profit booking:

Target as per Cup & Handle pattern is calculated by adding height of Cup to neckline which comes to Rs 590, however one can book profits near previous swing high which is around Rs 580.

Stop loss:

Entire bullish view negates on breaching of Handle on closing basis and one should exit from long position. In case of Amara Raja, it is placed around Rs 444 levels.

Conclusion:

We recommend buying Amara Raja Batteries around Rs 500 with a stop loss of Rs 444 for higher targets of Rs 590 as indicated in above chart.

There are as many as 54 stocks that are trading at valuations lower than the global financial crisis of 2008.
Yet it may not be correct to measure a business merely based on the P/E ratio, suggest experts.
The crisis of 2020 is the existential crisis and not the financial crisis that we saw in 2008.
Well, there are over 50 stocks that are trading at a lower valuation when compared to the global financial crisis.",A lower P/E ratio does not always imply that the company is undervalued. The reason behind the lower P/E ratio can be the poor financial performance or decrease in earning.,"Stocks that are trading at a P/E multiple which was lower than 2008 levels include ITC, HDFC Bank, Infosys. Kotak Mahindra Bank, Wipro, Axis Bank, ONGC, IOC, BOCL, Bajaj Finance, SBI, and L&T.

“Out of all these stocks, one should see businesses that are least affected in terms of starting again after COVID-19 is over. If lockdown does get extended then companies that have major supply chain issues are going to take bit longer to smoothen earlier track,” he said.

“Any decisions to invest in a particular stock cannot be solely on looking at P/E levels. As upcoming earnings growth or degrowth changes the entire scenario. The situation of COVID-19 is much different than the global financial crisis of 2008,” Pritam Deuskar, Fund Manager, Bonanza Portfolio Ltd told Moneycontrol.

The question now is – are all stocks that are trading below 2008 levels an attractive buy? Well, the answer is ‘NO’. And, investors should avoid making that mistake of picking anything because it is available cheap.

The recent wave of sell-off pushed many bluechip and midcaps stocks to their multi-year low which makes them an attractive buy at current levels, data showed. There are as many as 54 stocks that are trading at valuations lower than the global financial crisis of 2008.

Many quality large as well as mid-cap stocks have fallen in double digits in the past two months as a spike in COVID-19 related cases across the world triggered a risk-off sentiment that led to relentless selling by foreign investors of more than Rs 60,000 crore in the cash segment of the Indian equity market in March.

P/E ratio is the shortest & fastest way to get started when valuing a company. Yet it may not be correct to measure a business merely based on the P/E ratio, suggest experts.

“A lower P/E ratio does not always imply that the company is undervalued. The reason behind the lower P/E ratio can be the poor financial performance or decrease in earnings,” Gaurav Garg, Head of Research at CapitalVia Global Research Limited- Investment Advisor told Moneycontrol.

“Similarly, a higher P/E ratio does not always indicate that the company is overvalued. The reason behind the higher P/E ratio can be an increase in earnings at a higher rate or overall improved financial performance,” he said.

This means that if the company increases its earnings then investor’s decision of investing in high P/E ratio stock is not always wrong because ultimately due to an increase in earnings, the P/E value will fall in near future.

Valuation is an important factor while picking stocks, and no doubt most of the companies are big-ticket names in their respective sector. But, basing your calculation on just one indicator might not be enough because situation in 2020 is completely different what we saw in 2008.

Why we say that is because if the lockdown does get extended we are looking at massive earnings downgrades in almost all the sectors leaving aside defensives. The crisis of 2020 is the existential crisis and not the financial crisis that we saw in 2008.

“If there is something that the global financial crises episode in the past has taught us is that picking stocks only because they are trading at cheaper valuations is an inappropriate strategy. What investors need to look for are good businesses,” Nirali Shah, Senior Research Analyst, Samco Securities told Moneycontrol.

“Quality businesses that have the ability to tide through tough times and emerge stronger by increasing their market share are the true winners. Undoubtedly, many stocks are now available at attractive levels. Investors can keep this as a starting point to pick the fundamentally strong hidden gems to invest in,” she said.

Other factors to track:

There are other factors that one should keep a tab on while making a buy or a sell decision. Price-earnings ratio is a good barometer; however, experts feel that more investors should also consider companies with low supply chain issues, have a strong balance sheet, as well as high RoCE companies.

“Rather than P/E, the PEG ratio is an important factor investors should check before buying stocks. Comparing P/E to the growth of companies is a strong measure to predict if indeed the valuations are cheap vis-à-vis the growth of a company’s business,” says Shah of Samco Securities.

She further added that return ratios such as ROE, ROCE, management and supply chain efficiencies, leverage, free cash flow are a few other factors to look out for before investing in stocks.

What to buy?

Well, there are over 50 stocks that are trading at a lower valuation when compared to the global financial crisis. But, analysts recommend only a handful of names for cherry-picking.

Garg of CapitalVia Global Research Limited- Investment Advisor recommends HDFC Bank, ITC, NTPC, as well as L&T.

Shah of Samco Securities recommends a number of names such as HDFC Bank, Infosys, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Marico, Bajaj Finance, Hero Motocorp, Tech Mahindra would be good picks for investment at this point in time. A staggered buy approach would be a sound way to play the current volatility.

Both Sensex and Nifty50 rallied by about 13 percent for the week ended April 9 while the broader markets underperformed as the S&P BSE Mid-cap index was up 11.3 percent, and the S&P BSE Smallcap index closed 9.4 percent higher.

It was exciting three days as bulls helped the S&P BSE Sensex, and Nifty50 climb key resistance levels. Investors’ wealth rose by over Rs 12 lakh crore in a truncated week.

Positive global cues helped bulls to fuel a massive short-covering rally on D-Street. Foreign institutional investors who were net sellers in March and most part of April also turned net buyers in the last three sessions pouring over Rs 4,000 crores.

Expectations of further stimulus measures from the government, fall in new cases of COVID-19 in the United States as well as Europe, and expectations of smart money moving towards India post-MSCI rejig helped the sentiment.

""The benchmark indices ended with a positive note with an expectation of stimulus package from the government. The number of COVID-19 cases in India is low compare to the other nations like US and European countries like Italy, Spain where the number of deaths is in thousands as compared to the hundreds in India,"" Gaurav Garg, Head of Research at CapitalVia Global Research Limited- Investment Advisor told Moneycontrol.

""Although the government has announced various relief measures to save the economy, investors are still expecting a second stimulus package from the government which might be focused on MSMEs which is the worst hit,"" he said.

The coming week will be an interesting one as the initial lockdown period will come to an end. But, initial reports suggest that this period is likely to get extended.

On the macro front, inflation data will be eyed and a further stimulus from the govt. to boost the economy or support the MSME sector will lift sentiments.

""This uptrend seems to be a short term bear market rally and may not be sustainable. In India, there is an expectation that the worst affected sectors and MSMEs may get some relief in another package to be announced shortly,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial told Moneycontrol.

""Markets will continue to fluctuate based on news coming out regarding the spread of infections and any lifting of lockdown in India,"" he said.

Technical Outlook:

Equity benchmarks settled the truncated week on a cheerful note underpinned by firm global cues. The Nifty50 closed the week at 9,111, up by 12.7 percent.

The Nifty Mid-cap, small-cap behaved in tandem with benchmarks as it rallied over 7 percent, each. Sectorally, all major indices ended in green led by auto, pharma, and financials.

The weekly price action formed a sizable bull candle carrying higher high-low after seven weeks decline, indicating a pause in the corrective phase.

Any cool off from hereon due to elevated global volatility would get anchored around 8,500 as it is 61.8 percent retracement of last three session sharp up move (8,055 – 9,132), at 8,466, suggest experts.

“In the process, index surpassed intermediate resistance of 9,000, on expected lines, signifying acceleration of upward momentum towards 9,500 in coming weeks, Dharmesh Shah, Head – Technical, ICICI direct told Moneycontrol.

“Hence, the near term breather towards 8,500 should not be construed as negative, instead it should be capitalised as an incremental buying opportunity in the upcoming truncated week,” he said.

We have collated a list of factors that could be driving optimism on D-Street:

Strong Global Cues:

Tracking strong close in the US markets, Asian shares also started on a firm footing on hopes the COVID-19 pandemic is nearing a peak and that governments would roll out more stimulus measures.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said the state’s efforts at social distancing were working in getting the virus under control in one of the biggest hotspots in the country, said a Reuters report.

Shares in China, where the novel coronavirus first emerged late last year, rose 0.37 percent. Australian shares were up 3.46 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng was up 1.38 percent and South Korea's Kospi gained 1.61 percent.

European markets too traded higher with Germany's DAX rising 0.4 percent and Britain's FTSE up 0.65 percent at the time of updating this copy.

Investors will keep a close eye on stimulus measures likely to be announced by the government and the possibility of extension of lockdown amid rising numbers of coronavirus cases, suggest experts.

A second stimulus package India is poised to announce in the coming days will be worth around 1 trillion rupees ($13 billion) and focus on help for small and medium businesses weathering the coronavirus outbreak, two senior officials said on Wednesday, said a Reuters report.

Last month, India outlined a Rs 1.7 lakh cr economic stimulus plan providing direct cash transfers and food security measures to give relief to millions of poor hit by an ongoing 21-day nationwide lockdown.

The official which Reuters spoke to said that a separate package could be announced for bigger companies after assessing the extent of the hit they have faced due to the lockdown imposed to fight the outbreak. Although, a finance ministry spokesman declined to comment on the report published by Reuters.

One of the big factors which fuelled optimism in global markets is the comment made by the US President on opening up the economy.

US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he would like to reopen the US economy with a “big bang” but that the death toll from the coronavirus needs to be on the downslope before that can happen, said a Reuters report.

Trump did not give a timeframe on when he would like to reopen the economy, but his chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said on Tuesday it was possible this could happen in four to eight weeks, added the report.

After pulling out more than Rs 60,000 crore from the cash segment of the Indian equity markets, foreign investors turned net buyers in the last two sessions pouring in more than Rs 2,600 crore, provisional data showed.

However, the applicability of recent buyback tax makes the promoters wary of going ahead with buybacks,” Umesh Mehta, Head of Research, Samco Securities told Moneycontrol.
Following the sharp correction in stock prices since Feb’20 and the multi-year low trailing valuations, Motilal Oswal analyzed and identified companies with strong cash positions and those that are potential buyback candidates.
MOFSL scanned through its coverage universe through the lens of (1) Debt/Equity, (2) Net-cash/market-cap, (3) High pay-out ratios, (4) and Trailing Valuations to come out with names which could be potential buyback candidates.
Thus, companies having net cash greater than 10 percent of their net worth for FY19 and FY20E can finance buybacks through cash and cash equivalents, said the Motilal Oswal note.",Companies having net cash greater than 10 percent of their net worth for FY19 and FY20E can finance buybacks through cash and cash equivalents.,"Indian market is down by about 30 percent from its recent high which has pushed many good bluechip stocks to trade at multi-year low trailing valuations. Top companies with comfortable cash positions could turn out to be potential buyback candidates.

Amid the market mayhem due to the COVID-19 outbreak, prominent companies such as Sun Pharma, Dalmia Bharat, NIIT Technologies, Granules India, Emami, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, Thomas Cook, Sterlite Technologies, Delta Corp, GHCL, and Ramkrishna Forging have announced buybacks recently.

The fall of Nifty from an all-time high of 12,400 to the recent swing low of 7,511 on March 24 has created a scenario where most of the stocks are trading at hefty discounts or below their intrinsic value.

“It is said that probably the best possible use of cash by businesses is when stocks can be bought below its intrinsic value – this applies to buybacks as well. However, the applicability of recent buyback tax makes the promoters wary of going ahead with buybacks,” Umesh Mehta, Head of Research, Samco Securities told Moneycontrol.

“It is best suited for the promoters to increase their holdings where possible. And if the promoters are of the view that the business is currently trading way below their intrinsic value, they may give a heads up for a buyback,” he said.

Following the sharp correction in stock prices since Feb’20 and the multi-year low trailing valuations, Motilal Oswal analyzed and identified companies with strong cash positions and those that are potential buyback candidates.

MOFSL scanned through its coverage universe through the lens of (1) Debt/Equity, (2) Net-cash/market-cap, (3) High pay-out ratios, (4) and Trailing Valuations to come out with names which could be potential buyback candidates.

Consumer, Technology and the Automobile sectors fit the bill perfectly in the aforementioned criteria. Additionally, MOSL ran two screens to highlight potential buyback candidates by considering companies that have (a) higher probability of returning cash to their shareholders, and (b) earnings/cash yield >6.5%.

Looking at companies that have higher net cash on the balance sheet and sustainable cash generation abilities throw up 15 names that include companies like ITC, Coal India, Maruti Suzuki, Bajaj Auto, Eicher Motors, NMDC, and ACC, etc. among others.

Companies where valuation have declined greater than 35 percent of their 5-year average (P/E for Consumer, Media, Logistics, Healthcare, Technology, Others, Auto, Retail and Telecom, and P/B for Capital Goods, Oil and Gas, Metals, Cement, Utilities and Infra).

A company can opt for buyback up to 10 percent of its net worth without a special resolution being passed and it can buy back up to 25 percent of net worth post a special resolution.

Thus, companies having net cash greater than 10 percent of their net worth for FY19 and FY20E can finance buybacks through cash and cash equivalents, said the Motilal Oswal note.

“The recent fall will be a big opportunity for the promoters and cash-rich companies to increase their holding in the company. Buyback from the market will be helpful to arrest the sharp declines and stabilise the price of the stock,” Jashan Arora Director, Master Capital Services told Moneycontrol.

There are 15 companies according to Motilal Oswal study which have an earnings yield and cash yield of over 6.5 percent that include names like ITC, HCL Technologies, Coal India, Bajaj Auto, NMDC, ACC, Bharat Electronics.

On April 8, India VIX, after hitting intraday low of 46.97, witnessed a sharp rally of almost 10 percent from the day’s low point.","Rohan Patil

After witnessing a positive breakout of a pennant pattern, the benchmark index Nifty went through a sharp decline and left a long trailing trail candle with closing inside the pattern on the daily chart on April 8.

It was a roller-coaster day for the Nifty. Among the sectoral indices, Nifty Pharma, Auto and Media managed to hold the gains while Bank, Financial Services, Realty, Metal and IT remained under pressure.

For the past two trading sessions, the breadth of the market has been in the favour of bulls, for every loser, there were more than three gainers.

Nifty's weekly chart does not seem to be that promising due to its straight vertical fall but momentum oscillator RSI (14) is currently below 30 level and most stocks are showing significant oversold rally, so one cannot negate a sharp oversold rally in benchmark index in coming days.

Once India VIX settles below 70 levels, there will be a decline in volatility.

On April 8, India VIX, after hitting an intraday low of 46.97, witnessed a sharp rally of almost 10 percent from the day’s low point.

Due to this sharp surge in India VIX, the market went through a roller coaster ride on April 8.

We are expecting Bank Nifty to trade in a broad range of 17,000 to 21,500 level.

A breakout on either side will give a classical consolidation range pattern breakout and will define the next level for the banking index.

Current chart formation suggests Nifty may find major support around 8,300 level which is well supported with an upward rising trend line, which is drawn by joining the lows of March 24.

However, on the higher side, the index will continue to face hurdles around 9,150 level. In the case of sharp short-covering and a pennant pattern breakout, Nifty may go to 9,650 level.

Here are three stock recommendations for the next 3-4 weeks:

HDFC Life Insurance Company | Buy | LTP: Rs 477.10 | Target price: Rs 540 | Stop loss: Rs 440 | Upside: 13.20%

The stock seems to have broken its last week’s consolidation range and is currently witnessing a pennant pattern breakout on the daily time frame.

The 200-week exponential moving average is acting as an anchor point and is one of the main reasons for the likely short-term bottom in the stock.

The counter has been forming a base near Rs 440 levels for the last few trading sessions which is supported by momentum oscillator RSI (14) which has rebounded from the oversold zone with positive crossover on a weekly interval.

Traders can accumulate the stock in a range of Rs 475-479 for the target of Rs 540 with a stop loss below Rs 440 on a daily closing basis.

ITC | Buy | LTP: Rs 178.60 | Target price: Rs 200 | Stop loss: Rs 165 | Upside: 12%

For the last couple of trading sessions, ITC has been sustaining above its horizontal trendline breakout on the daily interval.

The stock is trading above its 21-day exponential moving average and also above its four-week consolidation range on the daily scale.

This stock has been forming a base near Rs 165-170 levels for the last few trading sessions which is supported by momentum oscillator RSI (14) which has rebounded from the oversold zone with positive crossover on the weekly interval.

Traders can accumulate the stock in the range of Rs 178–179.50 for the target of Rs 200 with a stop loss below Rs 165 on a daily closing basis.

PVR | Sell | LTP: Rs 1,000.95 | Target price: Rs 820 | Stop loss: Rs 1,130 | Downside: 18.08%

PVR has breached its almost three-week-long consolidation pattern and is currently trading below its support level on a daily timeline.

Majority of indicators and oscillators are negatively poised and looking week.

The stock has drifted below its 50 and 100-day exponential moving average on the weekly timeframe, which indicates bears are in full control to push price lower.

The counter is likely to underperform the benchmark index which is visible on the Relative Strength (RS) indicator on a weekly interval.

Traders can short the stock in a range of Rs 995-1,008 for the target of Rs 820 with a stop loss above Rs 1,130 on a daily closing basis.

20,"April 09, 2020 01:29 PM IST",0,Kshitij Anand,This fund manager shares mantra for picking sectors for post-COVID-19 world,"Q) We have already seen a big casualty in the form of IndiaNivesh Securities broking arm shutting down the operations.
In the long term, markets will eventually reflect the inherent strength and value of the businesses comprising the market.
It helps to keep in mind that “In the short term the markets are a voting machine but in the long term a weighing machine”.
What are your views on earnings, markets, flows, as well as demand?
For investors, near quarter earnings growth does not change the fair value of good businesses by anywhere close to the magnitude of price corrections we have seen in the market.","With the low cost of money globally and various reforms carried out in the past, India should be able to attract more external capital","A) There is a lot of grey area and a lot of varied definitions of what comprises ESG and a company faring well on ESG scores by one criterion might have much lower scores by another.

Q) Do you think companies in the ESG space could get attention?

A) Such periods of high volatility, uncertainty and disruption do impact the smaller/vulnerable firms across industries and lead to higher degrees of consolidation. It is also a sign of a competitive/dynamic industry structure. I think it is no different within the financial services industry.

Q) We have already seen a big casualty in the form of IndiaNivesh Securities broking arm shutting down the operations. Do you think this could just be the starting?

These will include leading names in the private banking and insurance segment. Demand for various consumer discretionary items across segments such as passenger vehicles, AC, jewelry amongst others will get deferred but eventually, they will all come back. Market leaders in these segments should do well.

A) Many quality businesses run by good management, addressing large-sized structural opportunities and which have grown profitably in the past will continue to do so in the future across industries.

Q) We have seen massive wealth erosion in most of the top-quality stocks in FY20, and as we step into FY21 some of those names could give multibagger returns if someone is investing in them now. Which are the sectors that could lead the way?

But since there can be more volatility and remain so for an uncertain period, an investor can choose his/her approach basis discussion with his financial advisor. We think a mix of lump sum and staggered approach might be fine in the current circumstances.

In the long term, markets will eventually reflect the inherent strength and value of the businesses comprising the market. The recent ~35% correction brings valuations to attractive levels given that fair value of businesses have not got impaired anywhere close to what the prices are suggesting.

The global flows, in turn, are being determined more by factors such as fear. It helps to keep in mind that “In the short term the markets are a voting machine but in the long term a weighing machine”.

If they are unallocated/under-allocated to equity, given risk profile, this is a wonderful opportunity to correct that imbalance. The short term is expected to be fairly volatile and global flows will determine this volatility.

A) Investors should look at an allocation into equities only from within what they have kept aside as an investment/savings pool. These are good times to refresh this asset allocation.

Q) Smart investors might be looking to buy the dip – what would you advise – lump sum or staggered approach in direct equities or mutual funds?

Many quality businesses run by good management, addressing large-sized structural opportunities and which have grown profitably in the past will continue to do so in the future across industries will bounce back, Gaurav Misra, Senior Fund Manager- Equity, Mirae Asset Investment Managers India, said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.

Thus, India’s leading tobacco company might be ranked higher on ESG scores (by some rating methodology) than some well-managed consumer companies but get excluded by other ESG ratings (on basis of the sector).Similarly, India’s leading power utility is spending billions of dollars to reduce its NOX/SO2 emissions to be at par with gas-based plants and further improve its ESG score.

While predominantly thermal it is moving towards a larger share of Renewable’s organically and through acquisitions. Yet it is getting penalised for being a “thermal power (coal-based)” producer.

The thought behind a greater focus on sustainable aspects of environment and society, is important in the long term for everyone. Good governance which should include among other things, minority shareholder interest (through better risk controls, capital allocation, etc), was always important for us.

Q) What are your expectations from FY21? What are your views on earnings, markets, flows, as well as demand?

A) My expectation for FY21 is fluid and will depend on:

1) The timelines on how successfully India and other countries are able to contain the spread of COVID 19 and the concomitant development of drugs and vaccines, if any.

2) The appropriateness, efficacy, and optimality of various monetary and fiscal measures announced by the government.

In the short term, there is a partial/complete cessation of activities barring a few sectors such as agriculture, government administration/healthcare, utilities, telecom/internet, etc. This will lead to a sharp contraction of near term (next 1-3 quarters) GDP and pull-down corporate revenues and earnings as well.

In the short period, it is important that the supply shock is minimised by ensuring that supply and production chains across essential goods (including farming activity) and other segments (when opened up) are intact and functioning, otherwise, problems will get amplified.

India was emerging from a combination of cyclical and structural slowdown. The auto sector was in a cyclical downturn for over 4 quarters and expected to turnaround during the year.

Sectors such as real estate are to emerge from a structural transformation post demonetisation and RERA, while the banking sector was emerging from asset quality issues. In a way the starting point for India is advantageous.

We are coming from a low but improving base of overall activity and the coronavirus is an external shock to the Indian system.

Since the cause of the problem is external to India and it is not a structural problem or one of our own making, one can be hopeful that recovery could be fast (if healthcare and monetary/fiscal interventions are successful) as well.

However, given the novel nature of the virus, the pandemic problem could persist/spread for longer. In that scenario the recovery as and when it starts will be slower and gradual. A longer pandemic episode could hurt more firms and create more job losses.

Thus, it is still a very fluid situation and we are not sure on the magnitude of earnings that might be cut for FY21. For investors, near quarter earnings growth does not change the fair value of good businesses by anywhere close to the magnitude of price corrections we have seen in the market.

Hence in a way a lot of the expected medium-term weakness and possibly more has already been discounted by the markets.

Since the markets have corrected by over 35%, valuations on all parameters are at attractive levels. The Market Cap to GDP as well as the overall Price/book is now at a level it was during the Global Financial Crisis of 2008-9.

Historically, Indian markets have been found at the current valuation range only about 5% of the time. The bond and earnings yield gap are also at a maximum post the GFC. These are attractive entry levels for an investor looking for absolute/relative returns.

Of course, the markets can correct more but I cannot predict that. On the other hand, in periods of uncertainty and weak economic cues – strong well-run businesses tend to be more immune and gain market share at the cost of weaker firms.

Lastly, major economies have undertaken a lot of monetary/fiscal easing. This will help global economies on the upside when it starts. The monetary expansion will also lead to some money coming back to attractive emerging markets such as India.

Domestic money inflows, especially through the SIP route, have held up well in all recent bouts of volatility. I expect this to continue and it shows the better understanding investors have of the underlying volatility and investment horizon expected from this asset class.

Q) Once the lockdown is over and we (the whole world) come out of COVID-19, what will be the new normal which the world will be looking at in investments, insurance, food habits, consumption etc.?

A) Ultimately, India will retain its structural-demographic advantage. With the low cost of money globally and various reforms carried out in the past, India should be able to attract more external capital.

There could be an increasing trend towards greater sourcing from countries beyond China and India could attract more FDI in select industries as one of the alternate manufacturing hubs in the world.

There could be a greater move towards online shopping of financial-investment/insurance products, other services – such as education, higher levels of work from home, as well as for online shopping.

There could be an increasing shift toward robotic manufacturing. Typically, we would expect more movement towards the organised sector on the criterion of quality and safety in segments such as food staples. Many of these trends were underway post GST and demonetisation.

Maybe some trends such as the extensive use of Ola/Uber are reversed as people prefer their own vehicles on safety grounds. Deeper shifts in consumer behaviour will depend on the duration of the lockdown and the pandemic.

Additionally, there could be a strengthening of the country’s medical infrastructure and capacity.

Edited excerpt:

Q) What would you advise – lump sum or staggered investing approach, direct equities or mutual funds?

A) Lump-sum investment is usually advisable in a scenario when most of the risks appear to be factored in the valuations and you have a broad judgment about the quantum of risk.

During the current pandemic, the situation is extremely uncertain with regards to both containment of the crisis and subsequent recovery process.

Hence, we would advise the investors to adopt a staggered investment approach over 6 to 12 months horizon and use every dip as an opportunity to increase the investments commensurating with individual risk appetite and investment objectives.

Q) IndiaNivesh Securities' broking arm shut its operations. Do you think this could just be the starting?

A) As they say, no crisis should go waste. Our industry has experienced the Karvy episode before, and now it is IndiaNivesh. I think the industry will be up for some serious consolidation.

This could be either because of an aggressive business model or un-sustainable operating leverage. Either way, there will be consolidation and optimization of industry players. Robust risk management and customer-centricity would be a key differentiator.

Q) A lot has been talked about and spoken about COVID-19 hotspots. But where are the hotspots in terms of investment in the current scenario?

A) One can always find hotspots irrespective of situations. In the context of the current scenario, potential opportunities could be in Consumer Staples, Telecom, Healthcare and OMCs as hotspots.

Based upon how quickly we come out of lockdown with calibrated lifting up, we may see healthy recovery in sectors like Retail, Hospitality, Cement, Paints, Automobile, and Specialty Chemicals, etc.

Q) Do you think companies in the ESG space could get attention, and could probably turn out to be big winners once this (COVID-19) is over?

A) ESG sector has been gaining prominence for the last couple of years especially since topics such as global warming, climate change impact, etc. have gained momentum across the globe.

Notably, there are dedicated onshore or offshore funds, which invest only on ESG stocks, as these stocks also carry relatively low regulatory interferences.

The Nifty ESG Index has been outperforming the benchmark Nifty for more than a year. We believe the ESG stock should continue to see traction and will grow in a big way post-COVID-19.

Q) With the starting of April we also start a new financial year – what is your expectations from the FY21? What are your views on earnings, markets, flows, as well as demand?

A) The market was factoring in higher teen growth for FY21, which looks very difficult, given the current COVID-19 pandemic. In case the lockdown is not extended, the economy should come back on track over a couple of quarters.

But it is too uncertain to predict anything as of yet. We are likely to see a sharp earnings downgrade for FY21 and based upon the calibrated lifting up of lockdown and subsequent recovery there might be earnings growth in the range of 5-10 percent for FY21, which still looks to be decent given the current situation.

Q) Once the lockdown is over and we (the whole world) come out of COVID-19 --- what will be the new normal which the world will be looking at in investments, insurance, food habits, consumption, etc.?

A) Social distancing will be a new normal. The economy that so far has been focusing on sharing (Uber, WeWork, etc.) will now take a more balanced approach and will embrace distancing as a business proposition.

Focus on healthcare will grow. Also, work from home and less travel will become a new normal across sectors. This may have an impact on rental yields etc.

From the investors' perspective, they will keep looking for a better value proposition with a low degree of uncertainty. As soon as the COVID-19 crisis gets over, we believe the sectors, which have been battered badly and have the potential to revive faster will be lapped up by the investors.

Q) We have seen massive wealth erosion in most of the top-quality stocks in FY20, and as we step into FY21 some of those names could give multibagger returns if someone is investing in them now. Could you highlights 3-5 such stocks that hold that potential?

A) As we all know during these uncertain times, there are certain quality stocks that got hammered and have the potential to generate hefty returns once dust settled and economy begun to recover.

Stocks like ICICI Bank, Maruti Suzuki, Hero MotoCorp and UltraTech Cement, etc. can potentially generate relatively better returns in the large-cap space.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/keep-an-eye-on-esg-stocks-could-grow-big-post-covid-19-lav-chaturvedi-5117821.html

Avenue Supermarts, which operates the supermarket chain DMart, has been on the analysts' radar for its strong fundamentals.
Some experts place it in the category of a multibagger amid the COVID-19 lockdown being a top retail player.
Currently, the company has 196 DMart stores and expects to open 30 stores every year through its cluster approach.
The infusion of funds would provide Avenue Supermarts the ammunition to enhance its store expansion pace, resulting in higher revenue and profitability.","At a time when most of the midcaps are reeling under pressure, DMart stands out with an outperformance of more than 20 percent, so far, in 2020.","Veteran stock market investor Radhakishan Damani-led Avenue Supermarts seems to be breezing through the coronavirus storm. The stock, locked in 5 percent upper circuit six times since March, has rallied more than 23 percent in 2020.

Avenue Supermarts, which operates the supermarket chain DMart, has been on the analysts' radar for its strong fundamentals.

Some experts place it in the category of a multibagger amid the COVID-19 lockdown being a top retail player. It is also among the top picks for many domestic brokerages.

A K Prabhakar, Head, Research, IDBI Capital in an interview to Moneycontrol placed Avenue Supermart in the category of multibaggers of the future. The company had been growing at 25 percent in the last few years, he said.

“We think the company is pulling consumers away from unorganised stores due to high discounting and now, delivery to home on the minimum charge would help the company grow in the next few years around those levels,” he said.

DMart is focused on value retailing and offers a wide range of fast-moving consumer products, general merchandise, and apparel.

Currently, the company has 196 DMart stores and expects to open 30 stores every year through its cluster approach.

It offers significant discounts compared to e-commerce, modern trade (~6%) and general trade (~18%), which would drive revenue growth, say experts.

“The DMart chain offers a considerable amount of discount when compared to e-commerce platforms. The operating margin is higher compared to its peers due to the company’s low-cost structure,” Angel Broking said in a note.

The brokerage firm expects DMart to report consolidated revenue/PAT CAGR of 18% and 26%, respectively, over FY2019-22E. It has an accumulate rating on the stock, which is also in top picks category with a target price of Rs 2,395.

Consistent growth and profitability

One of the big factors that make the stock a good buy on dips is that it has delivered consistent performance over the years, which is a positive sign.

At a time when most of the midcaps are reeling under pressure, DMart stands out with an outperformance of over 20 percent, so far, in 2020.

Experts say that the coronavirus outbreak impact will be minimal on Avenue Supermart due to its non-discretionary nature of the business and a capital-efficient business model.

Over the years, DMart has been able to maintain consistent profitability and remains an exceptional performer in its peer group.

“Given the robust store operating metrics, DMart has progressively enhanced its return ratios despite being CAPEX intensive. We expect the impact of the virus to be limited owing to the non-discretionary nature of the business,” ICICIDirect said in a research note.

“In a bid to reduce promoter stake to 75%, the company had successfully concluded qualified institutional placement (QIP) placement worth Rs 4,100 crore. Incremental cash-flow infusion in the company is expected to significantly shore up store addition pace with foray into newer geographies. DMart has a capital-efficient business model generating superior RoCE of 23% and fixed asset turnover ratio of 4.1x,” it said.

The infusion of funds would provide Avenue Supermarts the ammunition to enhance its store expansion pace, resulting in higher revenue and profitability.

There are as many as 54 stocks out of 270 in the S&P BSE 500 index where FIIs hold majority stake and they have plunged more than 50 percent in the same period.

Stocks that fell more than 50 percent include names like Gayatri Projects, Vedanta, RBL Bank, JustDial, Ujjivan Financial Services, Adani Power, HEG, and M&M Financial Services, etc. among others.

FIIs have been net sellers in Indian markets for over Rs 60,000 cr in the cash segment of the Indian equity markets. They pulled out more than Rs 12000 cr in February, and over Rs 5,000 crore in January, data from Moneycontrol.com showed.

“The outbreak of Coronavirus across the globe has impacted the sentiments of investors worldwide. It has led to a sharp correction in the 54 stocks mentioned as they either belong to the sectors that are highly cyclical or are facing company-specific issues,” Ajit Mishra, VP Research Religare Broking told Moneycontrol.

“Further, given the heightened selling pressure by the FIIs in the past one month, the decline in the prices has aggravated. In our opinion, instead of focusing only on FII heavy stocks, the prudent approach here would be to stay with fundamentally sound stocks and accumulate them in a staggered manner,” he said.

Note: The tables given are for reference only and not a buy or sell recommendations

Due to poor macro environment and fears of recession looming, selling pressure was seen in stocks across largecap, midcap as well as smallcap. Selling pressure was not just limited to India but it was across the world.

“Equity Funds saw over $50 billion flow out during the quarter and Bond Funds set weekly and monthly outflow records on their way to their biggest quarterly outflow since 3Q13,” EPFR Global said which tracks institutional and individual investor flows in global markets.

“FII heavy stocks have underperformed the index as Sensex has slipped approx 30% recently in comparison to stocks which have fallen 50%, whereas investors are concerned it is advisable to invest money in fundamentally sound companies rather than just following FIIs, if the company you invested in is fundamentally sound one can hold the position,” Ritesh Asher – Chief Strategy Officer (CSO) at KIFS Trade Capital told Moneycontrol.

“Fundamentally strong companies such as HUL, Navin Florine, Granules India have so far effectively saved themselves from the heat of macro factors taking place,” he said.

What should investors do?

The next big question in front of investors what should they do if they have stocks in which FIIs are heavily invested. Does it make sense to reduce the holding? Or what are the other factors which should be looked at before pressing buy or a sell button?

Well, experts feel that FII ownership should not be looked in isolation when making an investment call. FIIs could be selling due to varied reasons; hence, it is not just limited to the fundamentals of the company.

It would be wise to first understand the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the company before taking any decision related to buying or selling the stock.

“Investors should look at both quantitative as well as qualitative factors before investing. They should see that the company has prudent management, strong corporate governance, comfortable valuation and healthy financials with long term growth visibility, lower debt to equity ratio and sound balance sheet,” says Mishra.

Asher of KIFS Trade Capital is of the view that investors should not worry about FIIs based data if they have invested in the correct stock, because in the past few weeks DIIs managed to absorb the sell-off made by FIIs.

“As mentioned previously, investors should go through the study of stocks they are planning to invest in like what does the company do, is it financially strong, who is the management, are there any corporate governance issues, product line, vision & mission, valuation, etc before taking any decision to buy or sell a particular stock,” he said.

edited excerpts:

A) The market is nervous as the number of coronavirus cases in India has been accelerating and there might be the possibility of another round of lockdown to contain the community spread.

As testing increased to around 10,000 tests per day, the number of coronavirus cases escalated to over 4,000, which is alarming. If the lockdown is extended beyond April around the world, the economic activity will slump and we could experience a deeper recession than 2009.

FPIs remained net sellers during March and pulled out nearly Rs 62,000 crore from equity markets. In the face of economic uncertainty, FPIs are pulling out the money from risky assets and parking it into safe havens like the US treasury. This is creating panic selling in the Indian markets.

From the economic perspective, with 87 percent of the workforce in the informal sector, the pain for lockdowns will be severely felt by India which will trigger unemployment and will squeeze the overall consumption demand.

A slowdown in demand will result in sharp cuts in corporate earnings growth in the coming quarters.

A) The pandemic was a health crisis that has now transformed into a financial crisis. Thus, the need of the hour is to find a cure.

The market is unlikely to see structural relief rally till then.

Other macro factors at this point of time are not so relevant except the massive stimulus package announced by the government to support the ailing economy and RBI’s monetary easing.

Thus, the revivals in sales numbers will be delayed given the current economic uncertainties caused by the health crisis. So, it is better to stay away from auto stocks at current market volatility.

A) As we know, ""cash is king"" in times of crisis and provides a cushion. Companies that have a strong balance sheet and strong cash flows and thus have significant cash per share will be protected from the downside.

Q) What should be the trading strategy of the coming week?

A) Domestic markets will track global market movements and the spread of the virus in both India and globally.

The developments with regards to viruses are very dynamic in nature and evolving and thus it is always better to stay invested in FMCG, healthcare, utilities & telecom stocks as defensive bets in this market.

A) While valuation indicators suggest that the bottom is near the previous levels, nevertheless, one shouldn’t forget that this crisis is, after all, a health crisis that morphed into a financial one.

Besides, never in history, economies have been completely shut down choking economic activity. Thus, unless the virus and the spread of the epidemic is contained, there are always risks of the further downside and it could be too early to call the market bottom till the time the cure is invented.

COVID-19 is an unprecedented event, unknown and unknowable at this point in time. The uncertainty of it has led to a crash in the markets world across and the ferocity and pace of the price damage is unthinkable.

Bear markets are always brutal and engulf all of the market participants with fear and make them behave irrationally. A patient investor can only look at the widening gap between value and price with incremental fall and gradually initiate buy in times of extreme fear in companies of his choice, provided the choices are fair in the first place.

Markets never go broke, companies do, and it displays the collective sentiment of the herd from extreme optimism to extreme pessimism from time to time.

The historical valuation metrics reflects the degree of correction from a historical standpoint and gives a good reference point to judge the severity of the fall and the degree of value emerging with incremental decline if at all, from hereon, whether be it P/E or P/B or Earning yield to Bond yield or Mcap to GDP. If there is “Panic” today, the “Unwinding” of it is also inevitable.

Nothing stays permanent in space and time and the pendulum of market and emotion swings both ways. Stay Fit & Stay Healthy and introspect in silence the irrationality to arrive at a fair decision.

Q) What are your views on the financial space? Does it look like the smart money is moving from financials towards defensives' names?

A) Financials are likely to be under pressure given the fact that even considering hypothetically the crisis is solved today itself, it will take the economy a significant amount of time to restart and get back to working at the previous levels.

The fall out of the same is rising NPAs and dismal intermittent credit growth. Thus, at this present moment, defensives are clear favourites.

Avoid illiquid stock options, and try to stick to index.

In the last few days, trading volumes have fallen across segments, causing havoc among traders. In this article, we will examine the effects of this, and what precautions we can take to decrease our risks:

1) Wider bid-offer spreads increasing costs

Bid-offer spreads have increased in the futures and options segment. This is lower on liquid contracts of Nifty and Bank Nifty futures, at the money options, and out of the money options.

In the illiquid contracts: in the money strikes and far dated futures and options are affected. Stock options are the worst affected.

How to deal with this:

Trade contracts which you know you will get exit from. Use limit orders instead of market orders. Avoid illiquid stock options, and try to stick to index.

2) Whipsaw takes out stop-losses

Volumes absorb volatility. As volumes are low, the volatility has spiked. This means in the whipsaw happening around supports and resistances, stop losses are getting hit.

How to deal with this:

Reduce the position size. Keep deeper stops that can accommodate the volatility.

3) Higher impact costs for larger orders

If there are 2 offers at 100, 2 stocks can be bought at 100. But, if liquidity is low, one offer is at 100 and another at 101. This makes the price 100.5. This extra 0.5 is the impact cost. Big traders have higher impact costs now

How to deal with this:

Stick to liquid contracts. Use limit orders instead of market orders.

Low liquidity causes gaps and sudden surges. Stop losses can be missed, leading to unlimited losses. An unusually higher number of holidays in India in April exacerbates the effects of this as India catches up with news from the overseas markets which remain open.

How to deal with this:

Systematic stop-loss orders should be kept in the trading terminal. Retail investors can consider moving from futures and naked options selling to risk defined strategies such as option spreads.

Most options have lower liquidity now. We already covered the bid-offer and impact costs. There is a bigger risk specific to options. Exiting options to book profit or loss has become difficult, and traders are getting stuck in positions.

This is especially dangerous in stock options which are delivery-settled, which needs higher capital and costs more.

How to deal with this:

Stick to liquid and cash-settled contracts like an index. Avoid less liquid stock options. Square off stock option positions before expiry.

Illiquid options are showing absurd prices, IVs, etc. This leads to incorrect decisions on premiums, break evens, Greeks, etc.

How to deal with this:

Sanity checks any option price you see. Double-check the bid-offer spreads. Stick to liquid options. Avoid illiquid times like the opening hours.

We have collated a list of 4 factors which probably fuelled optimism on D-Street:

Rally in Asian markets:

Asian markets rallied on strong price action seen on Wall Street after initial reports suggest that the coronavirus crisis may be levelling off in New York and receding in Europe.

Japan’s Nikkei rose 2% and has erased most of last week’s losses after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe promised a massive $991 billion economic stimulus package - equal to 20% of GDP, said a Reuters report.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan pared early gains, but rose almost 1%, it said.

India may get $1.3-bn passive flow: Morgan Stanley

With India swiftly responding to the delay in notifying sector-wise limits for investment in stocks by overseas investors, analysts at Morgan Stanley now expect MSCI to rebalance MSCI India weight in the emerging market (EM) index, Business Standard reported quoting a report from Morgan Stanley.

“To reflect this change along with removing the DR (depository receipts) in the foreign ownership limit (FOL) calculation. As a result, they estimate $1.3 billion in passive inflows into the Indian equities spread across a bunch of stocks,” the report added.

India lifts restrictions on 24 drug exports amid coronavirus

The government has lifted restrictions on the export of 24 pharmaceutical ingredients and medicines made from them, the government said in a statement, Reuters reported.

It had imposed the restrictions last month as the coronavirus outbreak disrupted global supply chains. Paracetamol, a common pain reliever, and its formulations were not included in the list of drugs freed up for export.

The 26 active pharmaceutical ingredients and medicines accounted for 10% of all Indian pharmaceutical exports and include several antibiotics, such as tinidazole and erythromycin, the hormone progesterone and Vitamin B12, added the report.

Pharma stocks have been gaining of late as industry experts and brokerages believe that the sector is better placed to navigate the crisis during COVI-19 outbreak even though the challenges faced by it are all same.

Value buying at lower levels:

The Indian market has fallen by about 30 percent from its recent high has put benchmark indices in an oversold zone.

""In a bearish scenario, sector leaders with relatively stronger balance sheets, higher earnings visibility, strong cash flows, and management with a good track record should be preferred.

Even though agriculture is a pain point, Macquarie does not expect a significant impact on HDFC Bank’s overall asset quality.
Cipla: Target Rs 535Key positives are steady growth visibility, recalibrated capital allocation, and attractive valuations, according to Macquarie.
Petronet LNG: Target Rs 325The core thesis on PLNG has not changed despite a volatile macro backdrop, and Macquarie sees a short sharp volume recovery post lockdown.",Macquarie has made wholesale cuts across their coverage which are in the range from a moderate 5 percent to some cases ~80 percent.,"The Indian government ordered a nation-wide lockdown on March 25, 2020, for an initial period of 21-days which could get extended to 1-2 months, Macquarie Research highlighted said in a report authored by Aditya Suresh.

In the report, Macquarie has taken a granular look at two scenarios that could emerge in the near future. In the first scenario which is also the base case – Macquarie sees a 1-month lockdown followed by 3 months to business as usual.

In the bear case scenario, there could be 2-months of lockdown followed by more gradual 6 months to normal.

Macquarie has made wholesale cuts across their coverage which are in the range from a moderate 5 percent to some cases ~80 percent. Sectors that look better placed are staples, IT, and pharma.

The report highlights the top 10 Macquarie India research ideas based on certain fundamental parameters such as Book value per share growth is greater than 10 percent, or there is an EPS growth of more than 10 percent, etc. among others.

HDFC Bank: Target Rs 1,499

Even in the bear case scenario if we assume the loan growth/credit costs post COVID-19 to be 12%/2.3% for FY21E (base 21%/1.3%), the stock still offers an upside of ~30 percent today.

“We consider credit cost of 2.3% to be excessive as ~80% of the unsecured loans is towards salaried employees which in our view would have a better ability to repay in these testing times,” said the report.

Valuations at 2.1x FY22E P/BV for a ~2 percent ROA provides a favourable risk-reward with limited downside risk. Even though agriculture is a pain point, Macquarie does not expect a significant impact on HDFC Bank’s overall asset quality.

Successful execution of the strategy of the new CEO has yielded success with the company’s organic growth rate being faster than the industry now. Even with a single-digit revenue decline in FY21E (due to global growth shocks), EPS decline would be less than 10 percent (due to margin resilience) against an 18 percent drop in share price in the last 1 month.

The stock has a strong net cash balance sheets (US$3.4bn) and a dividend yield of 4.7 percent. The target price if Rs830 is set at 17x FY22 EPS with ~30 percent upside.

HUL: Target Rs 2563

Macquarie is of the view that home care can benefit in the near term on account of stockpiling which we see normalizing in the next 2-3 months. Out of home consumption like color cosmetics and skincare can take a hit.

“We see long term positive trends in some of the categories like personal wash and packaged/nutrition foods. We believe the GSK merger provides a strong platform to grow the food portfolio. We believe the merger would be EPS accretive (~9%) from the first year, FY21,” said the note.

Superior portfolio constructs, strong distribution and investments in digital infrastructure will help consolidate market share. Macquarie values HUR at 50x FY22E.

ICICI Bank: Target Rs 684

Even if we factor a loan growth/credit costs of 8.5%/2.7% for FY21E in the bear case scenario (post-COVID) the stock offers an upside of ~50 percent today. “We have assumed credit costs to be higher than the GFC level credit cost,” said the note.

Though there will be job losses due to COVID-19, Macquarie believes that the delinquencies in the retail portfolio will be contained and will be fairly lower than the GFC levels as this time around banks has majorly lent to internal customers.

Valuations at ~1.5x FY22E P/BV for 1.5% ROA is very compelling and can offer reasonable upside from the current levels, added the note.

HCL Technologies: Target Rs 727

In the current volatile global macro environment, Macquarie is of the view that HCL has low exposure to BFSI (21% of revenues) and a diversified business mix with software: services mix of 35:65.

UltraTech Cement: Target Rs 3952

Given near term earnings uncertainty, Macquarie focus on asset-based valuation – Ultratech trades at US$128/ton, which is 5 years low and a mere 5-10 percent above replacement cost.

Given the fact that the company has over 20 percent market share, along with diversified geographical presence, strong brand and distribution network, the stock warrants a sustainable premium.

Dr Reddy’s Laboratories: Target Rs 3324

Macquarie is of the view that the market is discounting Dr Reddy’s steadfast focus on creating ex-US growth avenues (refer Fig) and better productivity. It expects ongoing efforts on rationalising costs and improving asset utilisation to boost cash generation.

GAIL India is trading at about 50 percent below our fundamental bear case valuation. Macquarie value GAIL’s gas transmission division and listed investments together at US$9bn EV or ~20% above today’s price.

Cipla: Target Rs 535

Key positives are steady growth visibility, recalibrated capital allocation, and attractive valuations, according to Macquarie. The FY21/22E EBITDA margins are higher than Street led by factoring in a higher upside from Cipla’s focus on profitable growth.

Cipla’s key strengths, its strong branded franchises in India and South Africa, are growing at a healthy pace.

Petronet LNG: Target Rs 325

The core thesis on PLNG has not changed despite a volatile macro backdrop, and Macquarie sees a short sharp volume recovery post lockdown.

FMCG and Pharma as it attracted fresh long interest.
Apart from that about 30 percent of the stocks witnessed unwinding divided equally between Long Unwinding and Short Covering.

However, considering the unpredictability of the pandemic it makes sense to keep the trades limited and protected.","Considering the unpredictability of the pandemic, it makes sense to keep the trades limited and protected. Hence, Modified Butterfly on monthly series options is advised.","Shubham Agarwal

After a sombre start to April, the Nifty50 tried to stage a comeback in the next session but got pulled deeper into the trenches amid uncertainty regarding the impact of COVID-19.

The index settled with a loss of 6 percent for the week ended April 3.

The carnage was worse in Bank Nifty as it dropped a whopping 13 percent in the week gone by. The diversity of impact in the returns is a little more painful when associated with the open interest (OI) activity in futures.

The reaction of traders in the futures segment was quite predictable as far as Bank Nifty is concerned which added over 13 percent in OI.

On the other hand, despite the fact that it’s the first week of April expiry, Nifty lost interest in futures especially later in the week, which was out of ordinary.

Aggregate futures attracted fresh directional interest in the first week augmenting itself by around 5 percent. What was more interesting to see was at least initiation of a bit of positivity.

As the participants soak the bitterness of the impact of the global pandemic, there were pockets in the now called essential sectors viz. FMCG and Pharma as it attracted fresh long interest.

Apart from that about 30 percent of the stocks witnessed unwinding divided equally between Long Unwinding and Short Covering. And finally, over 50 percent of the stocks added shorts.

Slicing it down further, FMCG added longs led by HUL, UBL, Dabur and Colgate Palmolive. Falling crude oil prices sparked the Oil PSUs with long additions in BPCL and HPCL. Pharma was one sector that added almost secular longs.

The only sector to witness the unusual unwinding this week was Cement led by the unwinding of interest in ACC and Grasim.

India VIX has dropped by 15 points this week to the level of 55.

Even though these are super elevated levels, it is better than the week before.

The increment in implied volatility has also taken a toll on liquidity, which could start getting restored if the implied volatility cools off.

Composition wise too, a lot of interest is now seen in the farther strikes, which because of the fatter premiums looks fairly attractive.

This is visible in Nifty as low as 6,100 strikes have also added a significant amount of interest. However, considering the unpredictability of the pandemic it makes sense to keep the trades limited and protected. Hence, Modified Butterfly on monthly series options is advised.

Modified Put Butterfly is a 4-legged strategy where 1 lot of Put close to current underlying level is bought against that 2 lots of lower strike Puts are sold and 1 more lot of Put is bought but closer to the Put sold strike.

This keeps the lower but constant profits in case of a downward breakout. This is a risk-averse and a universal strategy.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/keep-trades-limited-and-protected-amid-covid-19-deploy-nifty-modified-put-butterfly-spread-5109241.html

Just Dial | Buy | LTP: Rs 300.50 | Target price: Rs 342 | Stop loss: Rs 284.20 | Upside: 14 percentThis stock has corrected sharply in the recent turmoil and posted its all-time low of Rs 250 in the last week of March.
Although the market environment does not suit positions on the long side, we are advising this stock with strict stop losses.
One can look to buy for a target of Rs 342 in the coming weeks.","Last week, India VIX cooled off considerably from a 12-year high, which is the only sign of relief because it indicates the possibility of volatility reducing.","Sameet Chavan

During the previous week, the proceedings started with a strong cut on Monday and despite some pullback in the following session markets once again resumed their downward trajectory.

Eventually, the truncated week ended with nearly seven percent cut from the previous weekly close.

As we all know, markets are being driven by fear and till the coronavirus pandemic does not subside, the pain is likely to stay in the market.

Traders are advised not to create aggressive bets, especially leveraged positions in such kind of environment.

Last week, India VIX cooled off considerably from a 12-year high, which is the only sign of relief because it indicates the possibility of volatility reducing and thereby, shrinking the overall range of the market.

It would be important to see how things pan out over the weekend with respect to coronavirus.

As far as levels are concerned, 8,000 followed by 7,800 would be seen as immediate supports, whereas on the higher side, if the market has to see some relief, the Nifty needs to surpass 8,300-8,400 convincingly.

In the recent past, financial stocks have been facing terrible selloff and last week too, we saw tremendous underperformance from this space.

Moreover, it would be unfair not to mention the stupendous rally in pharma stocks on the last day of the week. It has been the safe-haven space for traders and investors in the recent meltdown and now it increases the possibility of the multi-year pain ending for this basket.

Here are two stock recommendations for the next 3-4 weeks:

Sun Pharma | Buy | LTP: Rs 376.45 | Target price: Rs 404 | Stop loss: Rs 357 | Upside: 7 percent

The entire pharma space has been the knight in the shining armour for the market participants in the recent carnage.

This laggard sector has not only showed reluctance to fall but also saw a stupendous rally in the last few sessions, especially on last Friday.

It would be too early to comment on this, but we may see early signs of revival for this basket after the underperformance of nearly five years.

Sun Pharma gave a decisive breakout from key short-term moving averages along with sizable volumes.

Just Dial | Buy | LTP: Rs 300.50 | Target price: Rs 342 | Stop loss: Rs 284.20 | Upside: 14 percent

This stock has corrected sharply in the recent turmoil and posted its all-time low of Rs 250 in the last week of March.

Looking at the last few days’ price action, it appears that the correction has halted for a while.

On April 1, we saw the first sign of strength as prices managed to close above the 5-day exponential moving average for the first time in the last few weeks.

In addition, the RSI-smoothed oscillator has confirmed a positive crossover in extreme oversold territory.

Hence, we expect the stock to give some relief in the next few days.

Although the market environment does not suit positions on the long side, we are advising this stock with strict stop losses.

One can look to buy for a target of Rs 342 in the coming weeks. The stop loss can be placed at Rs 284.20.

On the other hand, Kotak Institutional Equities has upgraded Bajaj Finance to a 'buy' from a 'sell' with a target price of Rs 2,700 from Rs 3,850 earlier.
Kotak said Bajaj Finance has built a solid data-driven lending engine that has helped it to read early warning indicators, toggle across segments and channels.","Brokerage firm Emkay Global Financial Services has downgraded the company to 'hold' from 'buy', revising the target price to Rs 2,331 from Rs 3,570 earlier.","Shares of Bajaj Finance tanked about 6 percent to hit their fresh 52-week low of Rs 2,083 on BSE on April 7 even as a day ago the company said despite a 10 days loss, the company continued to grow its assets, new loans, new customer acquisition and franchise in a steady manner during Q4.

In a BSE filing on April 6, the company said its customer franchise as of March 31, 2020, stood at 4.26 crore as compared to 3.45 crore as of March 31, 2019. During the March quarter of FY20, the company had acquired 19 lakh new customers.

Moreover, the company said it is assessing the adequacy of provisioning for identified large accounts and will consider enhancing provisions for these accounts. It is also considering one-time accelerated provisioning for COVID-19 to further strengthen its provisioning standards.

Brokerages trim estimates, keep mixed views

Brokerage firm Emkay Global Financial Services, in a report on April 6, said it had downgraded the company to 'hold' from 'buy', revising the target price to Rs Rs 2,331 from Rs 3,570 earlier.

""We downgrade Bajaj Finance to 'hold' from 'buy' and revised the target price to Rs 2,331 from Rs 3,570, corresponding to nearly 3.2 times P/B FY22E, considering elevated uncertainties around growth and asset quality. With management’s rising focus on recoveries and managing asset quality, growth will take a back seat at least for a few quarters,"" Emkay Global said.

Emkay is of the view that as the whole world is facing a recession due to the COVID-19 outbreak, India would not be an exception.

""With nearly 63 percent of lending to retail customers, nearly 91 percent business in urban and semi-urban areas and nearly 39 percent portfolio under the consumer durable segment, Bajaj Finance is the most vulnerable to the current scenario of lockdowns,"" Emkay said.

Also, with an average asset maturity of 24 months, the decline in disbursements would have a faster impact on growth resulting in speedy AUM rundown, Emkay added.

Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services has a 'neutral' view on the stock with a target price of Rs 2,625.

Motilal has cut its earnings estimate by 42 percent and 25 percent for FY21 and FY22E, respectively, to factor in the lower AUM growth and a sharp rise in credit cost, whose impact was partially negated by the opex cut.

Motilal expects AUM growth to slow down from 27 percent in FY20 to 8 percent in FY21, but revert to 20 percent in FY22.

""While we believe stock price correction (55 percent from peak) and current valuations (2.9 times FY22E BV) largely factor in the moderate economic growth and the resultant impact on earnings, near-term volatility may remain high as earnings have significant linkages to the prevailing COVID-19 situation,"" Motilal Oswal said.

Motilal Oswal believes that segments like two-wheeler financing, SME and loan against property will witness asset quality stress in FY21E. The brokerage estimates credit costs to jump from 2.5 percent in FY20 to 4 percent in FY21 and then moderate to 3.1 percent by FY22E.

On the other hand, Kotak Institutional Equities has upgraded Bajaj Finance to a 'buy' from a 'sell' with a target price of Rs 2,700 from Rs 3,850 earlier.

""We believe that increased risk to Bajaj Finance’s consumer and SME book from the current lockdown and on the back of an economic slowdown is priced in, post the recent sharp stock correction,"" said Kotak in a report on April 7.

""We significantly increase our credit cost estimates for FY2021E, slowdown our medium-term growth forecasts in the backdrop of increasing uncertainty and raise our cost of equity assumptions to reflect increased business risks in the current environment,"" it said.

Kotak said Bajaj Finance has built a solid data-driven lending engine that has helped it to read early warning indicators, toggle across segments and channels.

Kota believes that Bajaj will sail through these challenging times even as it may have to face rough weather in the near-term.

""The stock is down from its rich multiples, that assumed uninterrupted high-growth, to reflect current challenges. We believe that this is a good opportunity for long-term investors, many of whom, have believed in the story but were not comfortable to enter at higher levels, an approach similar to ours,"" Kotak said.

Kotak has reduced its estimates by 16-39 percent for FY2021-22E reflecting lower growth and higher credit costs; PBT before provisions stands reduced by 12-14 percent.

After the reduction, Kotak expects Bajaj to resume 19-20 percent RoE by FY2022E. The RoE decline in FY2021E (14 percent) will be sensitive to write-offs in the lending book, Kotak said.

15,"April 07, 2020 10:27 AM IST",0,Kshitij Anand,Every crisis is an opportunity! Utilise current scenario to re-organise portfolio,"The 45-year veteran investor from Mumbai said it felt similar to 2008, when the news of an impending global financial crisis, made the rounds.
Based on the sound advice given by Krishna, Arjun decided to make opportune use of the global crisis and added quality stocks to his equity portfolio at attractive valuations.
Analyse your financial standing and risk appetite:Portfolio re-organising is a task that must be done with due diligence.
Before getting started, analyse your financial standing and reflect on one of the core tenets of investing – your risk appetite.
At the same time, the current volatility offers a perfect opportunity to scout quality stocks at attractive valuations to add to your portfolio for meaningful gains in the long run.","Individual investors should remember that every crisis is an opportunity. The present situation is no different, should you choose to wisely seize it and use it to your advantage.","A few days ago, history repeated itself for Arjun. It was the day that benchmark indices recorded their single-biggest fall, just as the World Health Organization (WHO), declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.

Gains made painstakingly over the years were wiped clean within seconds. The 45-year veteran investor from Mumbai said it felt similar to 2008, when the news of an impending global financial crisis, made the rounds.

Like many other worried investors who lost their hard-earned money in the market tumble of 2008, Arjun was ready to hurriedly cut his losses and exit the capital markets, had it not been for his friend and financial advisor, Krishna.

Based on the sound advice given by Krishna, Arjun decided to make opportune use of the global crisis and added quality stocks to his equity portfolio at attractive valuations.

This helped him diversify his holdings further and enhanced his investments manifold, in the long-term. And just as he recalled the 2008 crisis, Arjun also recalled Krishna’s valuable advice and sought to do something similar now when markets in India and across the globe, have corrected stocks to extremely attractive valuations.

At a time when Morgan Stanley has warned of a global recession — with global rating agencies slashing their FY21 GDP forecast for India — here’s how you, as an investor, can use this volatility to take stock of your portfolio and reorganise it.

Analyse your financial standing and risk appetite:

Portfolio re-organising is a task that must be done with due diligence. Before getting started, analyse your financial standing and reflect on one of the core tenets of investing – your risk appetite.

With no expert view that can precisely predict the bottom, it is up to you to gauge your risk appetite accurately.

For instance, if you are in your late 30s with a family and liabilities to shoulder, calculate how much money you can redirect from long-term goals such as retirement to maintain current liquidity.

Similarly, if you are in your early 20s and have a high tolerance to risk, be more moderate in your expectations.

Remain invested in good quality stocks:

Crises like these, in my opinion, strongly test the true character of investors. It separates the veterans of volatility from the amateurs seeking to experiment.

If you have consistently invested in fundamentally-sound stocks, make sure to remain invested. Indian markets have overcome such crises in the past and have rewarded those who had the patience to wait out the storm.

At the same time, the current volatility offers a perfect opportunity to scout quality stocks at attractive valuations to add to your portfolio for meaningful gains in the long run.

Several high-value stocks would be trading at lower valuations and you should lap them up as soon as you can. Also, if you have invested in mutual funds through Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs), do not discontinue them, as that would be a mistake.

With dropping NAVs, your SIPs would fetch more units now, averaging out the cost of buying. Staying invested now would yield higher dividends in the long run.

Provision for liquidity:

In such uncertain times, liquidity is a major concern. With a slump in economic activities, most businesses have come to a standstill and companies are staring at losses.

Lay-offs can’t be ruled out. This brings me to another essential aspect of wealth management and asset allocation — building an emergency corpus.

Having an emergency corpus ensures that you can bank on it to take care of your daily needs and liabilities, without dipping into your savings or compromising on your earmarked capital for various investment milestones. Check your portfolio and make adequate provisions for this corpus, if not done so already.

Consider liquid funds that invest in securities with short-term maturities like 91 days that offer higher returns as compared to a savings account. Redemption is quick and easy and is processed within one (T+1) working day.

In conclusion:

Amid all the gloom and doom, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has made several big-bang announcements to infuse much-needed liquidity worth Rs. 1 lakh [1] crore, through long-term repo operations (LTROs).

These measures should help the Indian economy in combating adverse impacts of COVID 19, spur consumption and instil confidence amongst investors.

However, as individual investors, do remember that every crisis is an opportunity. The present situation is no different, should you choose to wisely seize it and use it to your advantage.

17,"April 07, 2020 07:27 AM IST",-1,Kshitij Anand,COVID-19 is an 'external health shock' which can get morphed into a ‘financial crisis',"It poses an existential crisis not only to human life but also to the world economy.
There are mainly three stakeholders in an economy - households, businesses, and the government.
Now the entry of COVID-19 brought the existential crisis for the households who were forced to remain indoors and practice social distancing.
To some extent, these packages also ensure the prevention of widespread bankruptcies in the private sector which is essential to prevent the current crisis from getting morphed into an economic crisis.
The only silver lining, seems to be in this entire episode, is the fact that it is still a health crisis and not yet a full-blown financial crisis.","Though the recession is given for the year 2020, global policymakers are doing their best to keep their key stakeholders afloat in their economies through stimulus packages.","Mazhar Mohammad

The world had a little idea of how dangerous an unknown virus, which was later named COVID – 19, can turn out to be. It poses an existential crisis not only to human life but also to the world economy.

This unknown little beast has brought down the global economies to a grinding halt.

There are mainly three stakeholders in an economy - households, businesses, and the government. Households own labour and capital which they submit to businesses.

Then businesses by making use of this labour and capital churn out goods and services. In this process, businesses pay money to the households who again create demand for goods and services.

In between some part of the wealth is shared with the governments in the form of taxes who again spend this money on welfare schemes. This flow of money keeps the economy rolling across the world.

Now the entry of COVID-19 brought the existential crisis for the households who were forced to remain indoors and practice social distancing. This has upset the business activity and stopped the production of goods and services.

Unusually, this not only led to the supply shock but also in course of time creates low demand as households run out of money.

In turn, the revenues for the government will also come down as households and businesses can’t contribute anything in the form of taxes to the government.

What can be the economic cost of COVID–19:

The global economy right now is in an unprecedented situation, which is worse than in the times of the great depression of 1929 and world wars as ‘households’ across the globe are locked down due to the life-threatening virus.

The historical statistics related to US Economy suggest that during the great depression of 1929 – 1933 the GDP of US Economy was contracted by 30 percent whereas unemployment rate peaked at 20 percent and in the last global financial crisis of 2008 US GDP was contracted by 8.4 percent (annualised) in the 4th quarter of 2008.

As COVID -19 crisis, as of now, appears to be still on the mid path without a nearby solution, the fear is that the world economy may slip into depression kind of scenario if liquidity taps opened by the world central bankers to provide rescue measures dry up before finding a medical solution.

Though at this juncture it will be very difficult to project to what extent there can be economic damage to the global economy it will be worthwhile to look at the damage suffered by the dragon economy which recently opened up from lockdown.

It already started experiencing defaults on retail loans as many individuals are finding themselves out of jobs and money. World Economic Forum expects sharp cuts in the growth of Chinese Economy as economists’ estimates only a growth of 2 percent against the targeted growth rate of 6 percent for the year 2020.

It can easily get translated into reality as the ‘worlds factory’ is open but its shoppers are still struggling with lockdowns in Europe, the USA, and Asia.

Its business activity in the last two months seems to be significantly down as pointed out by certain economic indicators as shown in the table below:

Though the recession is given for the year 2020, global policymakers are doing their best to keep their key stakeholders afloat in their economies through stimulus packages.

In this regard USA whose GDP is roughly around $21.6 trillion came out with a massive relief program through a special act on last 25th March v.i.z CARES ACT – Corona Virus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act which facilitated a $2 trillion stimulus package to provide aid to states, industry, and workers.

This stimulus amounts to 10 percent of its GDP. Similarly, Germany and the UK also announced stimulus packages which is equivalent of 5 percent of their respective GDPs.

To some extent, these packages also ensure the prevention of widespread bankruptcies in the private sector which is essential to prevent the current crisis from getting morphed into an economic crisis.

CARES ACT also sets up a $500 billion lending program for small businesses and health care sectors with incentives for businesses to keep employees on the payroll.

The only silver lining, seems to be in this entire episode, is the fact that it is still a health crisis and not yet a full-blown financial crisis.

Hence, as long as it remains health crisis and if a medical solution is found in the near term before policymakers run out of their liquidity weapons then sooner than later the economic activity shall find its feet firmly on the ground with quick rebounding capacity as Households will be no longer on social isolation mode.

edited excerpts:

A) In current volatility and stretched margin norms by SEBI, retailers are hardly able to participate. Many investors, Mutual Funds and even many institutions are stuck with their longer-term holding which is bleeding more than 20-25 percent.

Many margin calls are getting triggered. The fear factor in this market may lead to a further sell-off and liquidation of portfolio and redemption of Mutual Funds.

The current lockdown scenario also forced many corporates to generate liquid cash for payment of overheads, as well as wages.

A) Volatility is a very common factor since correction has started. So, intraday moves of 3-5 percent in Nifty cannot be ignored in the next couple of weeks.

At the same time, India VIX has corrected by around 35 percent from the top. It shows that the market will be volatile but it will remain within a range.

As far as options data is concerned, the strike of 8,000 and 9,000 in April monthly expiry has seen the highest open interest, combining both put and call together.

Whereas, the total premium is 8,000 Strike is 960 and 9,000 strike is 1122. So, a broader range for the market will be 7,040 on the lower side and on the higher side 10,250.

In short, Nifty may retest the current low at the same time it has the potential to see sharp recovery and 9,000 levels can be tested easily.

On the other hand, fall of more than 7-8 percent in USDINR has seen inflows in the Indian market historically. So, long term investors may get a good opportunity to invest; whereas, for the traders, there will plenty of opportunities with low risk and reward ratio due to higher-stop loss.

A) The sales number will remain lower only on the back of the lockout and March ending. Even post-lockout, the economy will take at least a couple of months to get back on track and slowdown in the auto sector may continue.

A) 1. Cash-rich companies may sustain lockdown better way than other companies;2. It will provide them with the opportunity to go for a strategic investment plan so that exponential growth can be achieved;

3. Corporate benefits like dividend and buy-back can be easily done.

A) The strategy should be to:

1. Invest in defensive sectors like Pharma and FMCG;2. Avoid high beta stocks;3. To invest in Gold for Hedging against uncertainty.

4. Invest in safer stock like ITC, Abbot India, and Sanofi

A) Every shock in the market creates an opportunity for longer-term investors. No one currently is in a position to comment on the bottom as the disease continues to spread globally.

Currently, stocks that are getting affected due to lockdown and getting in cheaper rates should be zeroed for investment. Stocks like INOX, Indigo are few of those.

A) Due to global slowdown and lockout, the small scale industry will get affected adversely. So, the problem of NPA may worsen in the coming quarters.

Unemployment may spurt if the current situation does not come under control. All these thing will create pressure on the financial sector. It is better to switch to the defensive for shelter in this current scenario.

The strategy involves a high level of experience in the market as one has to look at the historic prices of stocks and current market conditions especially during the economic slowdown or unstable conditions.","For Nifty, 7,800 and 7,500 will act as support levels and 8,700 and 9,000 will be the resistance levels, Gaurav Garg, Head of Research, at CapitalVia Global Research Limited - Investment Advisor, has told Moneycontrol.","The novel coronavirus pandemic, due to its economic impact, has been the major cause of decline seen in the markets. The popular notion of value buying still holds, but it may be a while before that phase starts, Gaurav Garg, Head of Research, at CapitalVia Global Research Limited - Investment Advisor, said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.

Edited excerpts of the interview:

Q. Another volatile week for Indian Markets with 8,055 as a base. What is causing panic in the markets – is institutional selling causing panic in the markets? What are the other factors contributing to this bloodbath on D-Street?

A. COVID-19 has been the major cause of the decline seen in the markets due to its economic impact. The current situation has made the market a bottomless pit and thus it is bleeding institutions by diminishing its holding value.

As a result, it has become imperative for institutions to loosen the baggage. The popular notion of value buying still holds, but it may be a while before that phase starts.

Due to the ongoing lockdown across the country, economic implications have been substantial, which is leading to an economic slowdown and affecting almost all sectors and without any concrete sign of recovery, selling pressure may exist.

Q. What are your views on the month of April? Will we be able to see some green on the screen? Earnings will be delayed what are other data points to look for?

A. The situation in April may continue to be the same without any development in COVID-19 cases as this will not reduce panic in the country.

Any affirmative approach by the government for aiding the economy may be perceived positively on the street. Auto sales figures may help to make informed decisions by investors.

Q. India’s M-Cap-to-GDP ratio has slipped below FY09-levels or below 2008 crisis do you think a bottom is near? It is at the lowest since 2006. It will be difficult to say that we are near the bottom but a good multibagger opportunity for the next five years if one invests now.

A. In the current crisis, the economic slowdown has taken a toll on Midcap stocks since they are not always cash-rich like bluechip companies, such prolonged shutdown and halted economic activity deeply affects the earnings of the mid-cap.

This situation, however, has a silver lining, it gives the opportunity to buy at lower levels for holding on a long term time frame. However, the current situation is not very promising as we can see a continuous rise in COVID cases and it is difficult to say if the bottom is here or not.

Once this pandemic issue resolves, economic activity can be seen gaining momentum basically due to increased consumption and therefore a judicious investment can be made for the next five years.

Q. What is your take on the auto sales numbers-do you think the pain is likely to continue in the sectors, and it is best to stay away?

A. The Supreme Court has ordered the automakers to clear their BS-IV inventory before April 1, but many of the automakers had failed to do so due to the nation-wide lockdown from March 24.

Although few automakers are saying that the sales figures for March 2020 should not be compared with March 2019 since the situations have been completely different.

The sales of Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, Hyundai Motor India Ltd, Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd (M&M), Tata Motors Ltd and Toyota Kirloskar India Pvt. Ltd has seen a decline of more than 40 percent on a YoY basis.

The automobile industry which largely depends on the domestic and international supply chain for spare parts has been disrupted due to the lockdown. With day by day increasing cases in India the sales of April might be much worse than March figures.

Q. This is one advice which is echoed on D-Street is that one should stay with cash-rich companies. Do you agree with the statement, if yes how will it help in dodging the COVID-19 bullet?

A. Before investing in a cash-rich company one has to go through the cash and cash equivalents which are one of the key metrics to identify the company’s financial soundness.

As an investor, one has to identify the reason behind the excess cash. A company may start investing in research and development or to acquire new business, etc.

But, during the economic slowdown, the cash-rich companies are most likely to wait for the right opportunity and invest selectively based on the assessment of a business, future growth, demand and supply of that industry.

Q. What is the trading strategy for the coming week?

A. With the continuation of the turmoil in Indian benchmarks indexes, one can opt for the “Buy Low Sell High” strategy. The strategy involves a high level of experience in the market as one has to look at the historic prices of stocks and current market conditions especially during the economic slowdown or unstable conditions.

Given the global scenarios on the COVID-19 pandemic, the market still looks downside. For Nifty, 7,800 and 7,500 will act as support levels and 8,700 and 9,000 will be the resistance levels.

The S&P BSE Mid-cap index was down a little over 3 percent while the S&P BSE Small-cap index saw a dip of nearly a percent for the week ended April 3.

Indian markets closed in the red for the seventh consecutive week. The S&P BSE Sensex fell by over 7 percent while the Nifty50 was down by 6.6 percent for the week ended April 3, but broader markets relatively outperformed in the same period.

Institutional selling, rise in coronavirus (COVID-19) cases across the world, as well as financial stocks because an extended period of lockdown in India could lead to large non-performing asset (NPA) in the banking as well as non-banking financial companies (NBFC) space.

“In current volatility and stretched margin norms by SEBI, retailers are hardly able to participate. Many investors, mutual funds (MFs) and even many institutions are stuck with their longer-term holding which is bleeding more than 20-25 percent,” Vishal Wagh, Research Head, Bonanza Portfolio told Moneycontrol.

“Many margin calls are getting triggered. The fear factor in this market may lead to a further sell-off and liquidation of portfolio and redemption of MFs. Current lockdown scenario is also forcing many corporates to generate liquid cash for payment of overheads, and wages,” he said.

Volatility is likely to continue for the month of April as well, suggest experts. The coming week is a truncated one which has only three trading sessions. The market will remain shut on Monday (April 6) on account of Mahavir Jayanti, and on April 10 which is a Good Friday.

INDIA VIX cooled off considerably from a 12-year high, which is the only sign of relief. It indicates a possibility of volatility reducing and thereby shrinking the overall range in the market.

“Today, the market is clearly driven by fear and sentiments, and till the time, things with respect to coronavirus pandemic does not subside, the pain is likely to stay in the market,” Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives, Angel Broking told Moneycontrol.

“Traders are advised not to create aggressive bets especially leveraged positions in such kind of environment. As far as levels are concerned, 8,000 followed by 7,800 would be seen as immediate supports; whereas on the higher side, if the market has to see some relief, the Nifty needs to surpass 8,300-8,400 convincingly,” he said.

It relies on a follow-through day (FTD), a device identified by historical research.
That big gain on rising volume is a follow-through day, which confirms that a new uptrend is underway.
A follow-through day can’t pick the exact day when a market bottoms, but it can get you close to the bottom.
Hence, a follow-through day should be used in conjunction with other indicators to provide firm evidence.",A follow-through signal doesn’t mean investors should go and buy with abandon. It just gives you the go-ahead to choose high-quality stocks with strong sales and EPS growth as they break out of their bases.,"Selling pressure by foreign institutional investors is likely to continue for some more time on Dalal Street but investors can look for opportunities in this market fall, Mayuresh Joshi, Head of Equity Research India, William O'Neil India said in a special ‘Market Podcast’ with Moneycontrol.

Earnings hit is going to be very severe for a lot of industries facing the heat whether it is aviation, hospitality stocks or movie exhibitors, and most likely these stocks are going to feel the pinch in terms of downgrades, said Joshi.

He advises investors to bucket in two groups. Till that time COVID-19 led uncertainty remains, pharma and consumption stocks which have leadership positions have certain elements of a margin of safety.

“And, as the curve starts falling and we move past Q1, these high beta co-related sectors and stocks which have leadership positions will come into focus again,” says Joshi.

Have we made a bottom? Track Follow Through Day

In recent times, the Nifty50 has corrected by over 33 percent from its all-time high of 12,431. However, it staged a follow-through day on March 31, 2020.

If history is to be believed, this may not be the bottom of the market. Joshi expects the index to make another one or more lower lows.

It is difficult to identify the start of a major stock market uptrend if you are relying on headlines and news. By the time reporters figure out what’s going on in the stock market, the best part is over.

MarketSmith India, a research report by William O'Neil India has defined set of rules to identify the upturn in the market. It will remove any personal judgment. It relies on a follow-through day (FTD), a device identified by historical research.

A follow-through day occurs if a benchmark index (Nifty in our case) delivers a strong gain (1.5% or higher) on a volume higher than the previous session. That big gain on rising volume is a follow-through day, which confirms that a new uptrend is underway.

A follow-through day can’t pick the exact day when a market bottoms, but it can get you close to the bottom. The most powerful follow-throughs usually occur on the fourth to the seventh day of an attempted rally.

There will be cases in which confirmed rallies fail. A few large institutional investors, who have large funds, can run up the market on any particular day and create an impression of a follow-through.

Hence, a follow-through day should be used in conjunction with other indicators to provide firm evidence. One of the other indicators is simply to check if there are fundamentally good stocks breaking out of sound bases.

A follow-through signal doesn’t mean investors should go and buy with abandon. It just gives you the go-ahead to choose high-quality stocks with strong sales and EPS growth as they break out of their bases.

In IT boom, the Nifty50 fell around 48 percent in more than one-and-half-year (from 1,732 to 898 levels), while the correction of more than a year in the global financial crisis was 58 percent from the peak (6,287 to 2,617 levels). In the COVID-19-led sell-off, the index corrected around 38 percent from its peak (12,430 levels) if we take the lowest level seen on March 23 and currently the fall was 33 percent (from record high seen in January till April 3, 2020).

""It is a Déjà vu (a feeling of having already experienced the present situation) all over again as markets have a tendency, once in a decade, of creating declines of high magnitude and velocity in a very short span of time. This always leaves the investors in an iffy kind of a situation as to whether the world is coming to an end,"" ICICI Direct said.

But in the following years, especially once the dust settles down, every recovery has given hefty returns provided one should pick the right time and right opportunities. Just to explain the reality of multibagger - the Nifty50 has taken nearly four years to rally around 4,900 points but it lost those same gains in just over 2 months due to COVID-19 that has taken nearly 65,000 lives with around 12 lakh infected cases worldwide.

In fact, the virus deliberately forced the major parts of the world to go for lockdown and as a result, raised fears of recession as well as depression which worried investors the most.

In large-mid-to-smallcaps, 80-90 percent stocks corrected sharply with the majority falling in the range of 30-90 percent during the phase of turmoil.

Hence, every expert on the Street advised buying quality stocks in a gradual manner instead of bulk purchases and waiting for the market bottom which no one has found yet in history.

""We believe that as more time passes, COVID curve will flatten across the countries as it has in China and South Korea.

Moneycontrol has collated a list of 18 stocks which have strong fundamentals and can deliver solid returns in the longer term.

Brokerage: Axis Securities

Titan Company: It has consistent growth and valuations have become attractive. Demand scenario will revive sooner than later.

United Breweries: It is one of the best consumption themes with solid long-term growth potential. The stock correction provides a good entry point.

Eicher Motors: It has solid premiumisation potential and has been a consistent value creator.

Kotak Mahindra Bank: It is one of the best franchises with consistent returns and the current valuations are reaching the stressed zone.

Bajaj Finance: The stock could correct further but the current scenarios present a good opportunity to accumulate the quality franchise.

ICICI Bank: The stock has seen deep correction but will be solid when the market bounces back. The stock will quickly erase the losses as it has a strong retail book.

Bharti Airtel: The business impact on account of COVID-19 will be limited. It is a good stock for capital protection and long-term growth.

Maruti Suzuki India: Low fuel prices and lower interest rates which all will work well for Maruti. The stock will see a solid bounce-back as the market revives.

Brokerage: ICICI Direct

Hero MotoCorp: It is an industry leader in the domestic 2-W segment with a market share of around 35 percent with its core motorcycle segment market share at around 50 percent. However, the company is likely to witness near-term headwinds in terms of a rebound in volumes amidst COVID-19 outbreak and more than anticipated price increase on account of BS-VI transition (more than 10 percent).

From a broader perspective, however, it possesses capital-efficient business model realising more than 25 percent return on capital employed (RoCE) on a consistent basis and offers an attractive dividend yield of around 5 percent.

Heidelberg Cement: It is one of the few companies in the cement space, which despite having a regional presence, possesses a strong balance sheet and retail presence. HCIL, like most other cement companies, would be facing volume disruption in the near term. However, they would be able to withstand the same comfortably owing to cost leadership, strong promoter backup and low D/E of 0.3x. Post the sharp correction in the stock price, HCIL is now available at attractive valuations.

Wipro: In the near term, the company may face revenue pressure due to exposure to affected verticals like energy vertical, lockdown, pricing pressure and a slowdown in discretionary spend. However, post H2FY22, we expect IT spending to improve and grow at a healthy pace in FY22.

In addition, digital acceleration, gains in market share led by automation and pick-up in execution could drive large deal wins. The recent correction in the stock price factors in most of the near term negatives and is trading at an attractive valuation.

Tech Mahindra: In H1FY21, the company may face revenue and margin pressure led by COVID-19 lockdown, pricing pressure, delay in deal ramp-ups and slowdown in discretionary spend. However, we expect IT service spending to improve post H2FY21 and a revival in FY22. Further, the company's leadership in telecom vertical will make it a key beneficiary of vendor consolidation in the segment and 5G opportunities. Enterprise business segment will also benefit from improved competencies, sharper market positioning and success in large deals.

Bharat Electronics: COVID-19 will have an impact as some projects may get delayed but the anticipated medical devices order from government amid COVID-19 outbreak and likely operational relaxation by respective state governments to aerospace and defence firms from India Lockdown may lead to some cushion in FY21.

Overall, strong order book of Rs 51,300 crore (which is 4x book to bill ratio) continues to provide strong revenue visibility. BEL currently exhibits attractive valuations, has always paid consistent dividends, commands a debt-free balance sheet and generates strong cash flow from operations (CFO) yield.

KSB: Historically, the company maintained DPS to tune of Rs 5-6/share, which provides a dividend yield of 1.5 percent. Further, the company is making FCF/share to the tune of Rs 12-15 proving FCF yield of around 3-3.5 percent. Moreover, the company has been generating other income to the tune of Rs 40 crore on cash of Rs 207 crore.

Based on CY22 estimates, the earnings yield of the company is well over the 10-year G Sec yields. Historically, a positive spread of equity over bond yield provides a better investment opportunity. Hence, we expect downside in KSB from present levels to be limited.

Gujarat Pipavav: Gujarat Pipavav was expected to see major disruptions during March and April, as most of the services on the GPPL port are meant for the Far East (China in particular), which saw disruption due to the annual Chinese new year and then the COVID-19 crisis.

However, faster than expected ramp-up in the Chinese container ports (workers allowed to return to the port, factories restarting), would lead to clear the backlog of cargoes and de-bottlenecking of the global EXIM cargo movement (re-positioning of containers stranded at the Chinese ports).

The increased container movement between the Far East and India would lead to a higher capacity utilisation for GPPL (with a favourable product mix of EXIM cargo compared to coastal cargo movement).

Kewal Kiran Clothing: Though the near term revenue growth would be impacted owing to the impact of COVID-19 (closure of stores due to national lockdown), however over the longer term the management is looking to achieve double-digit revenue growth and has alluded at a possibility of dilution in margin profile to a range of 18-19 percent.

Despite the same, KKCL remains one of the most profitable branded apparel players having a robust balance sheet with cash & investments worth around Rs 270 crore. We expect the working capital days to inch up in the near term owing to liquidity stress faced by the Multi Brand Outlets (MBO) channel.

However, with the company having robust cash & investments, we do not foresee a significant increase in working capital debt. The debt/equity ratio is comfortably placed at 0.2x.

Mahanagar Gas: Although the company's sales volumes are expected to decline in the range of around 30 percent in the near term due to lockdown amid COVID-19 outbreak, we expect the steady volume growth once normalcy is restored.

Going ahead, we estimate total volume at 3.4 mmscmd for FY22 with volume growth at 7.3 percent CAGR for the next two years. Low gas prices and strong pricing power will help MGL to report healthy margins of Rs 14.6/scm in FY22. On account of attractive valuations, strong return ratios and favourable government policies, we expect MGL to be a beneficiary of India's growing CGD sector.

TV Today: TV Today has maintained its leadership in the Hindi news segment with Aaj Tak and India Today has seen an increase in market share, over the past five quarters. The monetisation across digital platform continued to remain robust as the digital segment has continued to display strong growth. We believe news heavy events will help the company to maintain growth momentum in broadcasting revenues in the medium term. Another attractive feature is the dividend yield. With no major capex, we expect the company to continue paying high dividends (already paid Rs 20 per share in FY20).

8,"April 04, 2020 09:17 AM IST",1,Kshitij Anand,April 2020 could reasonably be better as markets are deeply oversold: Umesh Mehta,"Institutional selling is not a big worry at the moment as Foreign Institutional Investors (FII)/Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPI) selling is actually cooling off now.
Given that the markets are deeply oversold, April 2020 could reasonably be better and consolidate at or around current levels.
Maruti Suzuki saw a decline of 47 percent while TVS Motor’s sales more than halved in March 2020 which indeed is abnormal.
Nonetheless, this ratio acts as one of the indicators to channelise investors to remain invested at current levels.
The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not that of the website or its management.","The Nifty50 has retraced 61 percent from lows of 7,500 to highs of 9,050. Therefore, 8,000-8,200 levels should act as a support zone for a bounce-back rally which can take Nifty50 to 8,800-9,000 levels","A. Institutional selling is not a big worry at the moment as Foreign Institutional Investors (FII)/Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPI) selling is actually cooling off now. However, the big worry is uncertainty and the estimated time our economy would take to recover, in addition to how long this lockdown type situation prevails in combating the pandemic situation.

In addition to the above, another big worry is of the United States economy which is still not under complete lockdown and the number of infected cases is multiplying.

If in the future the US decides on a complete lockdown in order to contain the virus, then the global economic repercussions may be catastrophic as the US is the world’s largest consumer and a trickle-down effect on other economies would be first-hand.

A. The only data point investors and traders are currently tracking is the chart of rising coronavirus (COVID-19) cases in India and not the charts related to the stock market.

Given that the markets are deeply oversold, April 2020 could reasonably be better and consolidate at or around current levels.

A. The current situation is considered under abnormal periods and it is expected that the worst is largely priced in. Maruti Suzuki saw a decline of 47 percent while TVS Motor’s sales more than halved in March 2020 which indeed is abnormal.

Once the lockdown is over, how soon the demand picks up is a bigger worry. Hence, it is expected that the government soon come up with the most awaited scrappage policy which would act as a trigger for the automobile sector.

And, this at the current juncture, makes the sector a high-risk, and high-reward bet.

A. Investors should stay away from consensus views. At this point in time, cash-rich, debt-free companies are largely available in the FMCG sector and they are still trading at record high valuations making them a very crowded trade.

Instead, the ones with risk appetite should bet on financials, automobile, cement, paints sector wherein the demand only maybe temporarily postponed as compared to severe demand destruction for the long haul.

A. The Nifty50 has retraced 61 percent from lows of 7,500 to highs of 9,050. Therefore, 8,000-8,200 levels should act as a support zone for a bounce-back rally which can take Nifty50 to 8,800-9,000 levels. It is advisable for traders to keep a stop loss below 8,000.

Q. India’s Mcap-to-GDP ratio has now slipped below FY09 levels or below the 2008 financial crisis – do you think a bottom is near? It is at its lowest since FY06. It will be difficult to say that we are near the bottom but what is a good multi-bagger opportunity for the next five years if someone invests now?

A. India Inc saw a robust investment momentum from private equity in 2018 for the second consecutive year with a total investment of $26.3 billion (BAIN & Company: India Private Equity Report 2019).

Hence, the true market-cap to GDP ratio is slightly blurred as the PE inflows are not considered in the market-cap.

Nonetheless, this ratio acts as one of the indicators to channelise investors to remain invested at current levels. One may note that these indicators do not assist in the short term timing of the market and investors should not just jump and buy solely on the fact that the ratio is so attractive.

Strides said it has approval for Rx and OTC Ranitidine tablets for the US market, and it currently commercializes only the Rx product in the US.
Consequently, Strides submitted the requested data to the USFDA and until test results were available, Strides voluntarily suspended the sales of ranitidine Rx tablets in September 2019, the company said.
Subsequently, Strides said it announced the relaunch of Ranitidine tablets in the US market.
Solara Active said Ranitidine API was amongst its top 10 APIs for company and contributed around 7 percent to its total revenues.","Ranitidine is an Rx and OTC drug used as an H2 (histamine-2) receptor blocker, which decreases the amount of acid created by the stomach.","Shares of JB Chemicals, Solara Active and Strides Pharma Science were down 6-10 percent intraday on April 3 after the US health regulator requested all manufacturers to withdraw all prescription (Rx) and over-the-counter (OTC) Ranitidine drugs from the US market immediately.

This latest step is based on their ongoing investigation of the N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) impurity in Ranitidine medications.

As per a statement from the US Food and Drug Administration, the agency has determined that the NDMA impurity in some Ranitidine formulation products increases over time and when stored at higher than room temperatures it may result in consumer exposure to unacceptable levels of NDMA impurity.

""As a result of this immediate market withdrawal request for all Ranitidine products, Solara has stopped further manufacturing and distribution of

Ranitidine API for the US market,"" said Solara Active in its BSE filing.

The company further said it would engage with its formulation partners to understand the next steps and additional data that it needs to generate for supporting their product's relaunch to the market in an extended period.

Ranitidine is an Rx and OTC drug used as an H2 (histamine-2) receptor blocker, which decreases the amount of acid created by the stomach.

Strides said it has approval for Rx and OTC Ranitidine tablets for the US market, and it currently commercializes only the Rx product in the US.

In September 2019, following a citizen petition filed in the US by an online pharmacy, the USFDA had learned that some ranitidine medications contain NDMA at low levels and FDA issued a statement alerting patients of NDMA found in samples of Ranitidine. The agency, then, did not announce any intention to recall the product and requested all Ranitidine manufacturers to conduct laboratory testing to examine levels of NDMA in Ranitidine, recommending the use of an LC-HRMS testing protocol.

Consequently, Strides submitted the requested data to the USFDA and until test results were available, Strides voluntarily suspended the sales of ranitidine Rx tablets in September 2019, the company said.

In November 2019, USFDA announced the Laboratory testing and analysis2 of Ranitidine and advised the acceptable NDMA limits. In the summary of test results provided by USFDA, Strides' Ranitidine tablets were found to be within the acceptable limits for NDMA of 96 nanograms(ng) per day or 0.32 parts per million (ppm) which was also considered reasonably safe by most of the regulators for human ingestion based on lifetime exposure.

Subsequently, Strides said it announced the relaunch of Ranitidine tablets in the US market. The company also tested the NDMA content for all its commercial batches and its product met and continued to meet the FDA recommended NDMA specification limit of NMT 0.32 ppm within the labelled expiration date.

Meanwhile, JB Chemicals said it continued to market Rantac, the formulation of Ranitidine, in India. The company has taken steps to ensure that the NDMA in the product is within the acceptable limits.

Further, the company said it has not yet launched this product in the US market.

Solara Active said Ranitidine API was amongst its top 10 APIs for company and contributed around 7 percent to its total revenues. ""Solara does not foresee any significant impact on its growth trajectory and continues to maintain a positive outlook for the future.""

JB Chemicals was trading at Rs 455, down 9.86 percent, Solara was down 4.37 percent at Rs 434.70 and Strides Pharma was down 5.09 percent at Rs 309.70 on the BSE at 1458 hours IST.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/jb-chemicals-solara-active-strides-tank-6-10-as-usfda-requests-withdrawal-of-ranitidine-5105501.html

Yoga has helped me to a great extent at various junctures in my personal as well as professional life. To recollect the market journey over the years and even my personal investing journey, I clearly remember the tech/new economy stocks crash in early 2000 as well as during the 2008 sub-prime crisis.

There was a huge fall during those times, and on both these occasions, the market bounced back strongly. However, overall the bear market period back then for months was quite painful and most of the retail investors who could not handle the stress booked losses and decided not to come back for many years.

Those who could actually come out and thrived were investors who could handle these stressful occasions. Keeping their head intact and acting rationally helped them maintain their balance. At the end of the day, “handling stress” became the differentiator.

Strong mental health helped one to achieve financial goals. Needless to add that yoga and meditation techniques surely helped.

To talk about techniques, I normally practice “reflection” a form of mediation every morning and recollect previous day's events in chronological order without judging them. Over a period of time, one starts to get the benefits of this and it helps to be more aware or mindful about oneself.

At the subconscious level, one starts taking the right decisions as clarity emerges while practicing any kind of meditation technique.

I have been through this investing journey for over 30 years and witnessed severe market falls and then recoveries. There is no point in becoming extra anxious or extremely bullish or excited, and this realisation has come through yoga/meditation.

I have also come to realise that yoga is a way of life and one has to look at Ashtang Yoga (eight limbs) and not just physical aasanas. Most of the time when you talk about yoga, people relate this only with physical aasanas.

These eight limbs are Yama, Niyama, Aaasan, Pranayam, Pratyahara, Dharna, Dhyan and Samadhi and not just aasanas which is only one part out of eight.

To be successful in your journey, you need to be in the right state of mind or 'Chitta' are it is called in yoga.

Investing is not different and one has to reach that level of Chitta to be successful. Ekagra Chitta which is the focused mind is a desirable state whereas Nirudh Chitta is the highest point.

13,"April 03, 2020 01:45 PM IST",1,Sunil Matkar,Experts name 10 safe bets as valuations seem attractive amid market turmoil,"Some experts argue market valuations are attractive now, but the recovery might not be immediate given the lockdown in India and major parts of the world.
Private bank's rural market share is 15 percent while the urban market share is 33 percent.
HDFC Bank continues to gain market share both on assets and the liability side of the business.
Its deposit market share has reached to 7.3 percent in FY19 from 5.1 percent in FY15, however, its incremental deposit market share gain was 9.1 percent (highest in the industry) during the same period.
Trent’s strong balance sheet, strong business positioning and stores expansion plan make it attractive for long term investment.",Vineeta Sharma of Narnolia Financial Advisors said the sharp fall in valuation was an opportunity for prudent long term equity investors.,"There has been a real carnage on the Street in the last one-and-half-month as sentiment was hurt due to the outbreak of coronavirus and fears of resultant economic damage.

The rise of cases in developed nations - United States and Europe - worried investors the most. FIIs started pulling out money from emerging markets like India. As a result, we saw the biggest monthly outflow in March (Rs 65,816 crore)

Sensex and Nifty plunged over 33 percent from their record highs seen in January. Many stocks hit their respective multi-year lows.

Some experts argue market valuations are attractive now, but the recovery might not be immediate given the lockdown in India and major parts of the world.

""As far as value buying is concerned, the market itself is in the value zone. Most of the fundamentally strong stocks are available at almost five-year low valuations,"" Sundar Sanmukhani, Head of Fundamental Research Desk at Choice Broking told Moneycontrol.

""Our recommendation to the investors is to stick to quality fundamental stocks, which have minimal impact from the lockdown and can rapidly revive post that,"" he said. He is cautious on the equity market performance in the near term.

Vineeta Sharma, Head of Research at Narnolia Financial Advisors also said the sharp fall in valuation was an opportunity for prudent long term equity investors. ""Idea is to identify businesses where long-term competitive moat exit, the balance sheet is strong to tide short term pain and there is a secular business growth potential for the future.""

Here is the list of 10 stocks which experts feel are safe quality bets in the current market turmoil:

Expert: A K Prabhakar, Head - Research at IDBI Capital

ICICI Bank

It is one of the largest private bank with 5,275 branches network and loan book of Rs 6,35,654 crore. It trades at attractive valuations and trades less than 1-time adjusted book. It holds many subsidiary companies which can create additional value.

Avenue Supermarts (D-Mart)

Company is growing at 25 percent in the last few years and we think company is pulling consumer away from unorganised stores due to high discounting and now delivery to home on minimum charge would help the company grow in next few years around those levels.

HDFC Life Insurance

Life insurance as business is growing 15 percent CAGR in last 17 years in private sector and for next 10 years similar growth looks possible. Company grows faster than peers and has better margin and this correction gives better entry point.

Bharti Airtel

Now duopoly in telecom between Jio and Airtel would give pricing power to both these companies.

Muthoot Finance

Gold NBFC is safest in this crisis situation with NIM around 15 percent and loan book of around Rs 38,000 crore. It has one of lowest NPAs for high margin business.

Expert: Vineeta Sharma, Head of Research, Narnolia Financial Advisors

HDFC Bank

Over the last ten years, PSU banks have lost market share to more nimble and better managed private banks from 81 percent in 2009 to 66 percent in 2019. Private bank's rural market share is 15 percent while the urban market share is 33 percent. We remain confident that there is more room for large scale private banks to take away PSUs' market share as the formalization of the economy increases.

HDFC Bank continues to gain market share both on assets and the liability side of the business. Its deposit market share has reached to 7.3 percent in FY19 from 5.1 percent in FY15, however, its incremental deposit market share gain was 9.1 percent (highest in the industry) during the same period.

Currently the bank is focused to tap the rural opportunity offering retail products and banking services to the citizens across the country.

Trent

The Indian retail apparel industry is highly unorganized. Trent runs retail stores - Westside, Zudio, Star, Landmark, Zara and Massimo Dutti. The company has more than 97 percent own brand portfolio for Westside which is the largest contributor to revenues. Led by differentiated product offerings & store experience, Trent has accelerated the store expansion program in FY19 and operates more than 270 stores across more than 70 cities in India.

Focused on the speed of delivering the latest fashion each week and committed to faster store opening to scale up the reach, Trent revenues are expected to grow at 25 percent CAGR for the next 3 years. Trent’s strong balance sheet, strong business positioning and stores expansion plan make it attractive for long term investment. The company presently trades at 4 times EV/Sales.

Apollo Hospitals Enterprises

Apollo Hospitals is the largest hospital network in India with 70 hospitals, 10,000+beds and 10,000+ doctors. The healthcare services comprise 55 percent of the revenues. The Pharmacy chain has 3,428 outlets across 20 states & 4 union territories and comprises 39 percent of the revenues. The other business contributes 6 percent of the revenues. Apollo is highly competitive compared to other destinations for medical tourists while offering similar standards and quality care at a substantially lower cost (around 65-90 percent savings versus US).

The company plans to bring down the debt to Rs 2,500-2,600 crore (net debt/EBITDA <2.5x) post completion of the pharmacy restructuring exercise. We expect the healthcare business to grow at a CAGR of 12 percent and the pharmacy business to grow at a CAGR of 17 percent for the next 3 years leading to sustained margin expansion and ROCE improvement. The company presently trades at 1.78 times FY20 EV/Sales.

Tata Elxsi

Tata Elxsi offers electronic, software development and system design services to automotive and aerospace industries. The company works with leading car manufacturers and suppliers, in developing electronics and software for powertrain, infotainment, connectivity, active safety, and comfort and convenience. The software which comprised 2 percent in the total value of the car in 2002 has reached 10 percent and is expected to reach 40 percent by 2030.

The company has also diversified into Medical business which will be fastest-growing segment within Tata ELXSI. It now contributes 8 percent and growing at double-digit QoQ. We expect in the next two years to at least contribute 22 percent of overall revenue. The company has cash balance of Rs 500 crore in the book and is planning to go for M&A.

HDFC AMC

Penetration of mutual fund products in India is only a fraction of the global average. Mutual Fund industry is well-poised for strong growth due to rising awareness amongst investors. Also, rising penetration of the internet and smartphones is contributing to the ease and speed of financial services in India.

Promoted by Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) and Standard Life Investments Limited (SLI), HDFCAMC has strong corporate governance and is built on the trust of investors. HDFC AMC is India’s largest and most profitable mutual fund manager with Rs 3.8 trillion in assets under management. The company has huge operating leverage as most of the costs are fixed. Secular business growth ahead and efficient operation makes it an investment candidate.

ITC seems to be ready to take a u-turn after the fall in price halted around the reversal zone of a Bullish Butterfly pattern on the weekly chart and started rebounding in the last few days. The stock rose nearly 7 percent on April 3.

We are witnessing a double-bottom kind of formation on the daily chart. RSI oscillator started moving northward from the oversold territory on both daily and weekly scale, which is a sign of relief for the bulls.

The stock had a strong bear phase in the last one year and corrected by more than 50 percent. The fall was supported by the huge short formation in the futures segment.

The open interest has reached to highest ever level of 16.91 crore on March 6 but, we witnessed a good amount of unwinding in the stock in the later fortnight of the March series, indicating that traders gradually exited their short positions.

At the current juncture, the stock is comparatively light on positions and marginal long build-up is seen in the current bounce which is a positive sign for the counter.

Looking at the overall chart structure and derivatives data, we are expecting a bounce in the stock towards Rs 210 levels in the coming weeks. Thus, any dip toward 173 shall be used as a buying opportunity with a stop-loss of Rs 160.

We recommend a buy in Bharti Infratel around Rs 152 keeping a stop loss Rs 135, for target of Rs 188.
The appearance of emerging cup and handle pattern where handle is about to construct near the line of parity on daily chart indicates up side movement in the coming sessions.
Daily momentum indicator RSI seems to be taking support from its falling line while being trading in an oversold region on daily chart also creating positive rhythm in the scrip.

Formation of the weekly candle is a small red candle for Nifty, it is continuous 8th week of lower closing. The index had given a bounce back earlier but it could not sustain above 5 WMA and is now trading below 5 DMA. India VIX index has started cooling off after making the highest mark of 86 in the month of March and currently sustaining below 55 marks which suggests contraction of volatility under process and ideal scenario to go towards normal daily ATR.

Recently index touched the lower Bollinger Band placed around 7520 and sustaining above it indicates retracement of prices towards middle band or 20 DMA which is standing around 8900 marks. As long as the index is trading below 20 DMA, one should opt for sell on rise strategy.

Furthermore, prices are trading below 5 days DMA placed around 8400, down move towards earlier crucial support 7800/7700 can continue which can extend to swing low 7500. 7500 interestingly is 50% retracement mark from low of 2008 (2252) and high of 2020 (12430).

For the banking index, majority of the oscillators are in oversold zone and a relief rally towards 20000 levels is expected.

Below are the top 3 stocks which can give up to 23 percent return:

Bharti Infratel: Buy around Rs 152 | Target: Rs 188 | Stop loss: Rs 135 | Upside: 23%

The scrip has formed a cup and handle on the daily charts and is undergoing consolidation in the longer time frame. It is on the verge of resuming its prior trend. The momentum indicator MACD has crossed the signal line indicating a start of a trend. The RSI too is above its key 40 mark indicating positive momentum on its side. We recommend a buy in Bharti Infratel around Rs 152 keeping a stop loss Rs 135, for target of Rs 188.

Biocon: Buy around Rs 285 | Target: Rs 320 | Stop loss: Rs 268 | Upside: 12%

Daily chart of the stock reveals that demand is increasing and supply is diminishing as stock is taking support from line of parity showing a rebound from its lower levels. Prices are consolidating above the formation of the morning star candlestick pattern showing strength from bottom. With the chart looking attractive and decent volume participation witnessed, we recommend a buy around Rs 285 in this stock for an upside target of Rs 320, keep a stop loss of Rs 268.

Infosys: Buy around Rs 585 | Target: Rs 650 | Stop loss: Rs 550 | Upside: 11%

The stock bottomed out near the Rs 509-515 zones and it has been consolidating for last few days on daily chart. The appearance of emerging cup and handle pattern where handle is about to construct near the line of parity on daily chart indicates up side movement in the coming sessions.

16,"April 05, 2020 09:42 AM IST",1,Sunil Matkar,"Bet on these 33 stocks having low financial leverage, strong competitive positioning","As a result, Indian equity benchmarks crashed 35 percent from record high levels seen in January and investors lost around Rs 52 lakh crore of wealth in two-and-half-month.
LKP expects NBFCs to remain challenged despite liquidity-easing measures announced by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), due to wider credit spreads and asset quality concerns.
The Centre announced welfare measures worth Rs 1.7 lakh crore, while the RBI announced a Rs 3.7 lakh crore liquidity stimulus package.
But most experts feel that these measures being announced globally amid such crisis, generally help in the long term rather than the short term.
Along with equity, oil hit the most due to lockdown-led low demand across the world.","FIIs pulled out Rs 65,817 crore from Indian equities in March alone. The financial sector was hit the most as the lockdown impacts collection efficiency of MFI, NBFC, HFC, SFB and banks.","The market had taken nearly four years to rally from 7,511 levels in March 2016 to hit record high of 12,430 on the Nifty50 in January 2020. But it took only two months to lose those gains and reach the levels of 2016 again.

It was a complete devastation of every asset class in a short span of time by the novel coronavirus or COVID-19 pandemic, which reportedly started from China — the world's second largest economy — and spread to other parts of the world in a couple of months.

The pandemic has forced several parts of world to go for complete lockdown. Confirmed cases have surged past 12 lakh with over 64,000 deaths worldwide. As a result, Indian equity benchmarks crashed 35 percent from record high levels seen in January and investors lost around Rs 52 lakh crore of wealth in two-and-half-month.

""These are unprecedented times - haven't seen anything like this in four decades because it is more of a crisis of confidence than a financial crisis,"" said LKP Research.

FIIs pulled out Rs 65,817 crore from Indian equities in March 2020 alone, while financial sector hit the most due to lockdown that impacts collection efficiency of MFI, NBFC, HFC, SFB and Banks.

LKP expects NBFCs to remain challenged despite liquidity-easing measures announced by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), due to wider credit spreads and asset quality concerns. Lenders to segments like commercial vehicle, SME and self employed groups would face challenges, it feels.

The Centre announced welfare measures worth Rs 1.7 lakh crore, while the RBI announced a Rs 3.7 lakh crore liquidity stimulus package. But most experts feel that these measures being announced globally amid such crisis, generally help in the long term rather than the short term.

Along with equity, oil hit the most due to lockdown-led low demand across the world. International benchmark Brent crude futures crashed 68 percent from 2020's high seen in January and the fall of price below the production cost hit the oil producing countries very hard, but it was a boon for India.

""The biggest oil shock with two low cost oil producing countries flooding the market is in our view a worry for the USA in an election year at a time when the Pandemic is devastating its economy,"" said LKP.

India being a large importer of oil would save more than 1 percent of its GDP and companies consuming oil and having a certain degree of pricing power in its products stand to gain, it added.

The brokerage feels the impact of lockdown is a major risk for REITs due to fall in rental income, industrials and capital goods due to labour dislocation, hotels due to non-occupancy, multiplexes, aviation, logistics, transportation, etc.

""Job losses would in our view impact consumer discretionary sector as consumers defer and postpone purchases,"" it said.

As a result, selling was seen across sectors, with Auto, Bank, Metals, Realty and Media losing around 45-47 percent. Infra, IT and Energy were down 28-31 percent.

Hence, like every expert, LKP also feels it is an opportunity to accumulate quality stocks. The brokerage has advised accumulating in tranches, as business leaders having low financial leverage and strong competitive positioning in the below mentioned sectors are likely to gain after the COVID-19 crisis:

SBI, ICICI Bank, HDFC Life, Bharti Airtel, CONCOR, Finolex Industries, HDFC, JK Paper, HUL, Colgate Palmolive, Bharat Electronics, Cipla, United Spirits, among others, are included in its stock picks list.

The Cup & Handle pattern is believed to be one of the most reliable and popular patterns among traders community.

In technical analysis, a Cup & Handle pattern describes a specific chart formation that projects a bearish-to-bullish trend reversal. A Cup & Handle reversal pattern forms after a downtrend, and its completion marks a trend reversal to uptrend.

In the standard Cup & Handle pattern, we connect the high after Cup with the high created after the handle. A trendline is drawn by connecting these highest points of the two peaks, which is called as 'Neckline'. This trend line is the most important component of C & H pattern.

Why to buy Coal India?

C & H patterns are an integral part of technical analysis, but successful traders combine these techniques with technical indicators and other forms of technical analysis to maximize their odds of success.

Coal India is having a strong resistance line standing around Rs 142 levels indicating strong bullish breakout only above these levels. Recent formation of Cup and Handle pattern will give a breakout on a close above Rs 142 mark which suggests buying in the stock for higher targets of Rs 165. Volume can also add further insight while trading these patterns. Decent volume participation while giving breakout is also giving support to C & H pattern.

Figure 1. Cup & Handle pattern and Buy signal on Coal India

> A close above neckline (Rs 142) of Cup & Handle pattern is indicating trend reversal to uptrend.> Short-term moving average 20 DMA (Rs 138) defines short-term trend is providing support to buyers as prices are sustained and trading around it.> Mid-term moving average 50 DMA (Rs 132) defines mid-term trend is very well augur with bulls as prices are sustained and trading above it.

> Decent volume participation while pattern breakout will also give additional confirmation.

Profit booking

Target as per Cup & Handle pattern is calculated by adding height of Cup to neckline which comes to Rs 165. However, one can book profits near previous swing high which is around Rs 162.

Stop loss

Entire bullish view negates on breaching of Handle on closing basis and one should exit from long position. In case of Coal India, it is placed around Rs 127 levels.

Conclusion

We recommend buying Coal India above Rs 142 with a stop loss of Rs 127 for higher targets of Rs 165 as indicated in above chart.

18,"April 06, 2020 04:06 PM IST",2,Sunil Matkar,"' NBFCs/HFCs' eligible for moratorium on term loans, buy these 3 stocks for 31-102% return'","Among others, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, M&M Financial, SBI, HDFC, Indiabulls Housing, HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, IndusInd Bank were also caught in a bear trap, falling 2-9 percent.
But after discussions with management of various NBFC/HFC, brokerage Emkay cleared that the moratorium is applicable to NBFC/HFCs as well.
""Term loans obtained from banks by all NBFCs/HFCs are fully eligible under the moratorium and our discussions suggest that many NBFCs/HFCs would avail the same.
But NBFCs/HFCs are not eligible for deferment of interest on working capital loans,"" it said.
Technically, the brokerage feels not allowing NBFCs/HFCs to defer their term loans during the current crisis would completely deteriorate the entire liquidity measures undertaken by the RBI.",Emkay feels housing finance companies (HFCs) are better placed compared to asset finance companies (AFCs).,"Share prices of non-banking finance companies/housing finance companies, as well as banks, were hit hard on April 3 after a media report indicated that NBFCs/HFCs are not eligible for a three-month moratorium on term loans borrowed and are liable to pay regularly.

Reports further stated that the only option open for NBFCs/HFCs would be a separate LTRO (long-term repo operation) window through which banks can infuse sufficient liquidity in order to smoothen bond market transactions.

Nifty Bank index plunged 5.27 percent and Financial Service index dropped 4.25 percent on Friday. Shriram Transport and Cholamandalam Investment fell the most, down 16 percent and 12 percent.

Among others, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, M&M Financial, SBI, HDFC, Indiabulls Housing, HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, IndusInd Bank were also caught in a bear trap, falling 2-9 percent.

But after discussions with management of various NBFC/HFC, brokerage Emkay cleared that the moratorium is applicable to NBFC/HFCs as well.

""Term loans obtained from banks by all NBFCs/HFCs are fully eligible under the moratorium and our discussions suggest that many NBFCs/HFCs would avail the same. But NBFCs/HFCs are not eligible for deferment of interest on working capital loans,"" it said.

Technically, the brokerage feels not allowing NBFCs/HFCs to defer their term loans during the current crisis would completely deteriorate the entire liquidity measures undertaken by the RBI.

During the recent monetary policy meet (March 25-27), the RBI has offered a moratorium of three months to all term loan borrowers, who are likely to be impacted by the lockdown and social distancing during the COVID-19 outbreak.

""Since the deferment is available from banks, NBFCs with an elevated share of bank borrowings (Cholamandalam Investment, M&M Financial, Shriram Transport) may opt for a similar deferment from banks and are relatively safeguarded. However, NBFCs with a higher share of bond market borrowings (LIC Housing) could raise incremental money from the LTRO window at the cost of margins,"" Emkay said.

Its assessment suggests that NBFCs with relatively stronger liability franchise (HDFC, Bajaj Finance) would anyhow be better placed, as their ability to raise funds at lower costs would aid margin disruptions.

After further discussions with management, Emkay indicated that the only unclear aspect of this entire exercise is the rating downgrade of securitized pool of assets of such NBFCs and HFCs.

""As per management, the pool of assets, including such deferred loans, should be exempted from downgrade as the said restructuring mandate is from the RBI,"" the brokerage said.

""In case of ratings downgrade of such pools, NBFCs would suffer further margin pressure due to elevated discounting by pool buyers. Also, many financial institutions may opt to stay away from the securitization of these assets,"" it added.

NBFCs/HFCs are confident of resolving this issue with the RBI and SEBI soon.

Hence, considering above parameters, Emkay feels housing finance companies (HFCs) are better-placed than asset finance companies (AFCs) as the overall impact of the deferment would be more visible in AFCs since recoveries are better among large-ticket secured loans.

HDFC remained its preferred pick with safer asset composition (salaried mortgages), longer maturity duration (72 months) and superior collection efficiency (99 percent digital).

""Cholamandalam Investment has high preference followed by Bajaj Finance post the recent correction; however, elevated discretionary exposure (including auto) and shorter maturity duration keep us cautious. We prefer M&M Financial Services the least due to rising delinquencies and low coverage,"" said the brokerage which advised buying HDFC (with a target of Rs 1,971, potential upside of 31.4 percent), Cholamandalam Investment (Rs 253, potential upside of 102.4 percent), Bajaj Finance (Rs 3,137, upside of 42 percent).

But, is it time to buy the fear? Maybe not.

Warren Buffett once said, ""Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful"". One thing is certain that there is a lot of fear in equity markets across the globe. Institutional investors are selling equities to either raise cash or fund margin calls.

The COVID-19 outbreak which is a global pandemic is likely to have severe economic fallout for many countries,xc including India. Global rating agencies have warned that the world economy is likely to slip into a recession in 2020.

“Given the uncertainty, one may not be in a full “Greed-on” mode, but certainly it is time to loosen the purse strings. In numerical terms, valuations are at least 10 percent more favourable vis-a-vis 2 weeks ago,” Rakesh Parekh, Head - Portfolio Management, JM Financial Services told Moneycontrol News.

“Globally, we have gone through multiple viruses scares over the last two decades. And, the experience has been that while business disruptions lead to near-term pressure on earnings and cash flows, good quality solid businesses adjust and rebound quickly as things begin to settle down. Since stocks are cheaper, it is a good idea to start deploying cash,” he said.

Where is the bottom?

Yes, it is time to buy the fear but in a staggered way because the bottom could still be some time away. Although, India’s market capitalisation/GDP ratio has declined swiftly from 79 percent as on FY19 to 54 percent (FY20E GDP) – much below its long-term average of 75 percent and closer to the levels last seen during FY05 and FY09 – makes it attractive.

The Nifty is trading at a 12-month forward RoE of 15 percent, above its long-term average of 14.5 percent, Motilal Oswal said in a note.

Warren Buffett described this ratio (Market cap to GDP ratio) as the ""best single measure"" of where valuations stand at any given moment in one of his articles back in 2001 with Fortune magazine.

The ratio acts as a good barometer when it comes to studying market valuations, but experts differ that we have made a bottom – although, we might be trading at levels last seen during the 2008 financial crisis. The ratio is at its lowest level since FY06.

“The current situation is not very promising as we can see a continuous rise in COVID cases and it is difficult to say if the bottom is here or not,” Gaurav Garg, Head of Research at CapitalVia Global Research Limited- Investment Advisor told Moneycontrol.

“Once this pandemic issue resolves, economic activity can be seen gaining momentum basically due to increased consumption and therefore a judicious investment can be made for next 5 years,” he said.

This ratio acts as one of the indicators to channelize investors to remain invested at current levels. But, one may note that these indicators do not assist in the short term timing of the market and investors should not just jump and buy solely on the fact that the ratio is so attractive, suggest expert.

The other reason which makes experts believe that the bottom could be some time away is the fact that we have fallen just 30 percent in 2 months while history suggests that bottom formation has taken anywhere between 10-27 months.

“The final bottom in the four previous falls took 10-27 months versus less than three months in the ongoing fall,” said a CLSA report.

VK Sharma, Head PCG & Capital Markets Strategy, HDFC Securities told that the market cap to GDP ratio today is around 0.53, which matches that of December end 2008.

“While the Nifty, in the current bear market has fallen 39.57 percent to its low, in 2008 it had fallen as much as 61 percent,” he said.

Technical View

The Nifty formed a bearish candle on the daily charts.

Technically speaking, the Nifty needs to sustain above 7,800 levels in the current leg of downswing to retain a positive bias, which will subsequently give a lifeline to the bulls.

In case the Nifty closes below 7,610, then weakness will be confirmed, which will open up more downsides below 7,511 with initial targets of 7,341, Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research &Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in, said.

On the rebound from 7800 initially, downside target shall be towards 8,600.

For the time, traders are advised to remain neutral and wait for stability, said Mohammad.

In Pics | Here's what top corporate leaders have to say on lockdown extension The report further added that in the interim we may see values dip sharply again and again based on over discounting of fundamental deterioration or technical reasons like large selling by FPIs due to risk aversion. Hence, changing asset allocation, raising cash in the interim and redeploying later at lower levels (in same/different stocks based on a fresh evaluation) may help overcome the anxiety during deep selloffs (and its consequent impact on wealth effect). The hard truth is that the ultimate winners out of this turmoil may not be the same as those in your current portfolio. The three-week lockdown to contain the COVID-19 outbreak will mean that 75 percent of the economy will be shut down, resulting in a direct output loss of more than 4 percent. On the charts, the Nifty50 has fallen from 12,152 to 7511 and on bounces the retracement levels could be 9270-9846. In the best-case scenario, it could rise to 10294. “It could later fall again and in case we are able to contain the virus by April end (first scenario), then we could form a higher bottom at 7842-8160,” said the report. It further added that in case the virus lingers on beyond this date (second scenario), then we could breach the low of 7511 and go towards 6825-6357. HDFC Securities said that currently, they are not including any financials in their recommendations. Here are top 7 stocks from IT, consumption, oil & gas as well as from healthcare space: Apollo Hospitals Enterprises:



Apollo Hospital Enterprise Ltd (AHEL) is Asia’s one of the leading integrated healthcare service providers having presence in Hospital, Pharmaceutical, Primary Care & Diagnostic Clinics; Telemedicine units, Health Insurance Services, Global Projects Consultancy, Colleges of Nursing and Hospital Management and a Research Foundation, epidemiological studies, stem cell & genetic research.

This stock fallen over 25 percent in the last one month due to Corona Virus fears in India despite the fact that Hospital's business will be unaffected by the virus scare; if at all it may benefit out of it.

On account of increased pricing, better occupancy, and improved case mix, AHEL witnessed improvement in its hospital and pharmacy segment's profitability. Substantial debt-funded capex or acquisitions or inability to improve the EBITDA margins leading to the higher net adjusted leverage are some concerns

HPCL is an integrated refining and marketing company and has substantial oil marketing operations. It is the third-largest oil refining and marketing company in India. It owns and operates two refineries, one in Mumbai with a 7.5 million metric tonnes per annum (MMTPA) capacity and another one in Visakhapatnam with 8.3 MMTPA capacity.

Coronavirus outbreak has impacted industry demand and HPCL has to face volatility in oil prices. The stock has fallen by about 37 percent since Nov 2019 highs.

Crude oil prices have recently fallen to their lowest in nearly three months after the failed decision of production cut by OPEC nations, stoking fears about global economic growth. Trade tiff of the US with China has led to fears of further slowing down of the global economy which could impact crude oil demand and hence its prices.

The sharp drop in global crude prices in the last few weeks (correction in oil prices from ~US$45/bbl to US$22-25/bbl) provided respite to OMCs will allow the OMCs to raise margins.

Now onwards, normative margins could be restored allowing HPCL to be the largest beneficiary as its earnings are highly sensitive to changes in the marketing margins.

Hindustan Unilever Limited is engaged in fast-moving consumer goods businesses comprising home and personal care, foods and refreshments. The Company's segments are Soaps and Detergents, which include soaps, detergent bars, detergent powders, detergent liquids, and scourers.

HUL lost over 340 basis points to 38.9 percent in the skin cleansing category over the past two years dragged by a sharp decline in two of its largest brands— Lux and Lifebuoy — that together accounts for a quarter of the market.

The beauty care category was impacted by delayed winter for skincare and pricing correction in soaps, and the Personal wash market also declined in Q3. Rural demand has been weak due to lower-income, recovery in demand would take another two to three quarters.

edited excerpts:

A) Rising numbers of infections in the US, the fall of the US Indices, fear arising out of the super spreader event of Nizamuddin, is making the markets sulk.

We have handled the virus issue better than the US, UK or any other European countries and would have been celebrating the fall in the new infections after April 6 but that was not to be. Our vigil has now been extended.

A) This is very interesting.

Yes, the market cap to GDP ratio today is around 0.53, which matches that of December end 2008. While the Nifty, in the current bear market has fallen 39.57 percent to its low, in 2008 it had fallen as much as 61 percent.

I would recommend investors accumulate SBI Life Insurance in this downtrend for better than market returns in the next 5 years

A) The results would obviously be delayed and will not be good.

The only thing going for the markets is that the positions are very light in the April series. In fact, we have started the April series with an Open Interest (OI) of just 240 crore shares in stock futures.

This is the lowest since October 2015. The number is 54 percent lower than the all-time high seen in February 2018 and 43 percent lower than the last series.

In fact, the Nifty50 has fallen in all the past four series, something that only happened way back in 2002. But when that happened, the 5th series closed in positive.

The main data to be diced and sliced are the new infection numbers. As and when we see a plateauing out of those numbers, markets should bounce back.

A) The auto sector numbers were worse than expected, even counting the lockdown.

The sector has had no reprieve from the courts on liquidating their BS-IV inventory. They will get only 10 days after the lockdown is relaxed to sell their ware.

A) Cash-rich companies are great companies to back in uncertain times. As they do not carry the baggage of the interest on the debt, they will fare better in tough times.

Usually, they are available at a higher end of the PE spectrum but the current downturn has lowered all boats. So it’s a good time.

A) For the coming week, unless the tide turns in the infection numbers, one should stick to what is working and that is Pharma. There are trading plays possible in the sector.

A) Yes, the money is moving to Pharma and FMCG sector. Pharma stocks, which had lost the tag of ""safe"" stocks, have partially got it back, courtesy of the virus.

While the finance boys have been hit badly, but the better-managed ones will emerge stronger after the turmoil settles.

So, there is still a lot of time for these stocks to turnaround. Top banks with low NPAs and good margins should be picked again when the tide turns.

The brokerage said it was unlikely that generic Advair's would be launched by FY22, hence the same was not a part of its estimates.

At present, Mylan's Wixela Inhub is the only generic in the market. Mylan received product approval in January 2019 and launched the drug at a 70 percent discount.

""Sandoz has shelved off the generic Advair project after the USFDA rejected its application, while Hikma's (partnered with Vectura) application is currently under review (had received a CRL in the first review cycle).

Wherever the equity component goes down due to the fall in the market, investors should increase their equity exposure while maintaining a balanced allocation, and there can be a slight tilt to large-caps at this time, Mahesh Patil, CIO – Equity, Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC, said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.

Edited excerpt:

A) Indian equity markets have fallen 30-35 percent from the recent peak in mid-Feb. This is not just on the account of fundamental reasons but also due to high-intensity selling by foreign investors (FIIs) who have sold more than USD 8 billion in the past few weeks.

The sharp sell-off by FIIs is primarily from Quant funds, Hedge funds, Risk parity funds which had grown massively, some on leverage, when global liquidity was easy.

They had to forcefully unwind their positions amidst the high volatility as the VIX index touched record highs.

Also, global ETF flows indicate that investors are adding to positions in markets such as China, Japan, Korea, where COVID-19 has been seemingly peaked while reducing positions in other markets like India where the uncertainty remains.

DIIs, on the other hand, are mostly long-only and hence they would have deployed excess cash as the markets corrected sharply providing an attractive buying opportunity.

While the policy measures taken by our government and RBI came a bit late, they do provide some comfort to investors.

A) Yes, investors should rebalance their asset allocation. Wherever the equity component has gone down due to the fall in the market, investors should increase their equity exposure while maintaining a balanced allocation. There can be a slight tilt to large-caps at this time.

A) The large sell-off by FIIs due to increased volatility is largely over. Some amount of selling will continue until we see signs of flattening of the virus infection curve.

The domestic institutional investors (DIIs) on the other hand have seen good inflows in this month till date as investors and asset allocation funds move more money to equities seeing the markets at attractive levels.

They are providing some support for the market. However, if the lockdown is prolonged and the impact on the economy is much more severe, the savings will get impacted and the domestic flows could slow down.

This can put further pressure on our markets and we may re-test the recent lows if that happens.

While it is difficult to call a bottom at this point in time, the recent lows of the market should act as good support given that at those levels market fundamentals even on a trailing basis look very compelling.

A) The Indian government is tackling the COVID-19 situation in a step-by-step manner. The government has already announced a 21-day lockdown in an attempt to stop the spread of the virus.

They have announced relief measures worth Rs 1.7 lakh crore targeted to the low-income segment. The RBI also reduced rates by 75 bps, announced measures which will enhance liquidity in the system by 3.7 lakh crore, as well as a moratorium on loan and interest payments which should provide relief to a large swath of the population.

Overall, these measures should give some confidence to investors that India should be able to contain the virus sooner rather than later and that the government and RBI are working in a coordinated manner to cushion the impact on the economy.

However, in comparison to other economies like the US, Europe, and China, where a very large stimulus of almost 8-10% of GDP has been announced, we need to do more.

A large fiscal stimulus with targeted measures for various sectors that are bearing the brunt of the slowdown and which provides some relief to MSMEs as well is the need of the hour.

A) With the government announcing various measures to provide financial support to the low-income segment through its stimulus package, consumer staples should continue to see strong demand.

Small-ticket consumer discretionary segment may also do well. Retailing of consumer staples and small-ticket items should also benefit.

A) Good quality companies in small-ticket consumer discretionary sector which have corrected can bounce back. The demand destruction they have seen is temporary and they can see long term growth due to low penetration and rising per-capita income.

Private banks have seen a sharp correction but those with a strong liability franchise and high-quality assets may gain market share. Also, insurance companies should continue to see secular growth.

A) In a bearish scenario, sector leaders with relatively stronger balance sheets, higher earnings visibility, strong cash flows, and management with a good track record should be preferred. Investors should avoid companies with high leverage.

The bank is focusing to protect balance sheet rather than looking for balance sheet or income statement growth,"" said the lender.
The bank believes the economic recovery will take six to nine months if the coronavirus situation continued beyond a month (up to three-month time).
The Reserve Bank of India has given a three-month moratorium for the payment of loans after the lockdown.
Here are the highlights of Kotak Mahindra Bank's conference call, collated by KR Choksey:- The management foresees three types of scenarios.",The bank expects a lower recovery as customers who have the ability to pay will also hold back to enjoy the RBI moratorium and to have liquidity in difficult times.,"Kotak Mahindra Bank share price fell more than 10 percent intraday on April 1 after the private lender talked of increased risk and cost due to extended moratorium and warned of default if recovery was delayed.

The stock has plunged 31 percent in two months, as the 21-day lockdown to control coronavirus raised fears of defaults that could result in NPA pressure. The stock was trading at Rs 1,163.30 on the BSE, down Rs 133.05, or 10.26 percent, at 1058 hours.

While addressing conference call, the country's fourth-largest private sector lender said it was seeing problems in unsecured personal loans such as credit cards and consumer durables, especially from customers who are fence-sitters and have the ability to pay but not the will. ""Extra efforts are required to remind them through calls,"" it said.

""Defaults are expected to rise due to which recovery will be delayed. The bank is focusing to protect balance sheet rather than looking for balance sheet or income statement growth,"" said the lender.

The bank believes the economic recovery will take six to nine months if the coronavirus situation continued beyond a month (up to three-month time). ""The management sees urban areas more problematic than non-urban areas.""

The Reserve Bank of India has given a three-month moratorium for the payment of loans after the lockdown.

""The extended moratorium will increase the risk and costs for the banks due to the asset-liability mismatch,"" it said.

Here are the highlights of Kotak Mahindra Bank's conference call, collated by KR Choksey:

- The management foresees three types of scenarios. In the first scenario, the end of COVID-19 situation in 15-30 days' time (optimistic scenario) and everything will be normal in about two months.- Scenario Two, assumes this situation to continue beyond 1 month (up to three-month time) economic recovery will take six-nine months for recovery.- Scenario Three extends beyond three months, which is pessimistic. The company expects extended health problems and recovery, salary cuts and job loss. The management believes we are in Scenario Two.

- The management sees urban areas more problematic than non-urban areas.

- On the liability side, the banks witnessed an increase in customer deposits although not significant but better than expected. There was an uplift in saving deposits and a marginal increase in current and term came from existing customers, other private banks including Yes Bank (post moratorium) and small finance banks.- The bank doesn’t have too much government deposit exposure and hasn’t noticed a significant movement in these.

- On the assets front, the bank has been cautious about SME lending for the last one year. On the retail front, the bank will remain cautious but continue to grow home loans and unsecured loans, while on the wholesale front, the bank has been selective and not taken any concentrated bets.

- The management believes this situation will require geared up efforts towards recovery of non-performing loans (NPLs) and proper recovery infrastructure in place.- Retail borrowers are expected to repay EMIs on priority such as home loans, card loans and two-wheeler loans will be prioritized as compared to other personal loans.- Expecting lower recovery as customers who have the ability to pay will also hold back to enjoy RBI moratorium and to have liquidity in difficult times.- The bank is seeing a problem in unsecured personal loans, which include credit card, consumer durables and other personal loans, especially from the customers who are fence-sitters and have the ability to pay but are not willing. Extra efforts are required to remind them through calls.- The bank believes, if you are not the first to reach the customer; you will end up losing money.- Defaults are expected to rise due to which recovery will be delayed.

- The bank is focusing to protect the balance sheet rather than look for balance-sheet or income-statement growth.

- The management sees that in the present situation, the NBFC sector is more exposed to the solvency issue than the liquidity issue.- On the liquidity side, the BFSI sector will face issues with regards to ALM mismatch, tightening of liquidity. However, these are manageable with infused liquidity and reasonable support offered by the Centre.- The extended moratorium will increase the risk and costs for the banks due to ALM mismatch,

- In the case of the pessimistic scenario, the bank is expecting all the problems mentioned above to raise to the power of two or three.

This black swan event has caused serious disruptions and brokerages and experts say the impact of the outbreak on the economy can't be measured precisely at this juncture.

Brokerages and analysts are of the view that the pain caused by the coronavirus may linger and the market is factoring in the hit on earnings and its economic fallout.

The coming few months are expected to be difficult, as global trade has dwindled and all financial markets have witnessed a meltdown.

Nobody knows when the pandemic will subside, what will be the magnitude of demand destruction and the extent to which asset prices will get reset across financial markets.

However, history show that financial markets discount such events at a rapid pace, sometimes overshooting on the downside.

At present, some of the best managed companies are available at attractive valuations. Brokerages advise one should accumulate companies (depending on their risk appetite and time horizon) which have gone through such challenging cycles and have come out much stronger.

Here are 10 stocks that look attractive to brokerages from long-term perspective:

Brokerage: ICICI Securities

Dr Lal Pathlabs | Buy

The company has consistently reported strong growth with incremental free cash flows in the normal course of business.

ICICI Sec said it was positive on the long-term outlook, considering the company’s strong brand franchise with sustainable growth, expansion potential, healthy FCFF generation and strong return ratios.

""We expect Dr Lal to outperform the industry growth and register revenue, EBITDA and PAT growth at CAGRs of 13.4 percent, 14.8 percent and 17.7 percent, respectively, over FY20-FY22E. We expect free cash flow generation of nearly Rs 780 crore over the next two years,"" ICICI Securities said.

""RoE and RoCE would remain strong at 24.3 percent and 22.9 percent, respectively, in FY22E whereas RoIC would move to 95.3 percent,"" it said.

HDFC Bank | Buy

HDFC Bank has efficiently focused on retail business and has garnered strong liability franchise to yield superior profitability over the years, said the brokerage.

Seasoned portfolio and management experience led to higher than industry advances growth at nearly 24 percent CAGR in FY08-19.

Enriched customer experience, a strong network of 5,345 branches and focus on digitisation has enabled the bank to build a strong liability franchise, with CASA comprising nearly 40 percent of deposits. Such high CASA limits cost of funds and thereby, enable to report superior NIM above 4 percent consistently, said the brokerage.

""Prudent asset quality has been core to the bank. The same has safeguarded the bank from NPA issues faced by the industry in recent fiscals. RoA at about 1.5 percent and RoE at 15-18 percent remain consistent for the bank with valuations expected to remain at a premium,"" ICICI Sec said.

Kotak Mahindra Bank | Buy

Kotak Mahindra Bank has built a network of 1,539 branches. Increased focus on retailisation of loans has enabled the bank to earn the best NIM in industry at 4.7 percent.

The savings rate was hiked by the bank to 6 percent in 2011, boosting savings deposits growth to Rs 2,39,354 crore by December 2019.

CASA ratio improved from 50.7 percent in December 2018 to 53.7 percent in December 19, which is the best in industry.

""Overall asset quality remained resilient with GNPA ratio at 2.46 percent in Q3FY20. The bank has no major exposure to IL&FS & other stressed assets. Going ahead, healthy business growth coupled with stable margins is expected to augur well for the bank,"" said ICICI Securities.

Titan | Buy

Titan Company is the market leader in the Indian jewellery market through its flagship brand Tanishq. The company also has a presence in watches and eyewear segments.

The company has also entered the online jewellery market by acquiring caratlane.com.

Volatility in gold prices, impact of coronavirus outbreak (closure of retail outlets due to a national lockdown) and reduced demand in discretionary spending are expected to impair consumer demand in the near term. However, the company is likely to recoup lost sales owing to pent up demand from H2FY21, ICICI Sec said.

The company has consistently exhibited ability to gain market share on a sustained basis amid a tough industry scenario. Robust balance sheet (more than 30 percent RoCE and virtually debt-free status) and asset-light distribution model have enabled it to outpace peers in terms of store addition.

It added 34 Tanishq stores for the nine months ended December 2019, which is equivalent to FY19 store addition, ICICI Sec said.

""Over the longer term, we expect Titan to be a key beneficiary as India’s gold market continues to strive towards regulation and standardisation,"" ICICI Sec said.

Dabur | Buy

Dabur India with a turnover of more than Rs 8,500 crore and earnings of more than Rs 1,400 crore has a strong portfolio of brands (Dabur Chyawanprash, Real, Hajmola, Vatika, Amla, Fem, Honey, Meswak, Dabur Red) with a focus largely on ayurvedic and healthcare offerings.

""With a wave of demand for the ayurvedic & natural products in addition to Coronavirus outbreak globally, staples segment including Dabur has been gaining significance especially its healthcare and home care categories such as Chyawanprash, honey, glucose, toothpaste, shampoos and hair oil,"" ICICI Sec said.

Dabur’s broad product portfolio provides a good play on Indian consumer goods spend by its strong presence in less-penetrated and high-growth categories.

The rural segment contributes around 45 percent of its sales, so it is well-placed to take advantage of the rural recovery.

Brokerage: Kotak Institutional Equities

Petronet LNG | Buy

Petronet LNG’s volumes have remained well above contracted levels historically and are expected to increase further with commissioning of Kochi pipeline post- lockdown and further expansion of Dahej.

""Our reverse valuation for Petronet LNG suggests the stock is trading at about 10 percent discount to NPV of long-term contracts, thereby pricing in materially lower off-take of volumes in the long run,"" said Kotak.

Kotak expects the company to continue paying higher dividends, pending investment in proposed overseas projects.

Lupin | Buy

""At this point, we see limited impact from COVID-19, with the lockdown impact on manufacturing and logistics likely to be smoothened out over the coming few weeks, though, we do see US FDA inspections for Somerset, Goa and Indore getting pushed back to H2FY21,"" Kotak said.

""We expect only a transient impact on domestic market performance with performance likely to be normalized from Q2FY21. However, we do expect a negative hit on EM sales given cross-currency exposure to South Africa (about Rs 600 crore revenues), as well as Brazil/Mexico (about Rs 600 crore revenues).""

However, the brokerage sees several levers to drive the EBITDA growth from FY2021, including market share gains in levothyroxine, gradual loss reduction in Solosec, as well as ProAir approval, with significant room to drive margin expansion through operating leverage.

The stock's valuation has also made it attractive at this juncture.

""Valuations remain compelling with the stock now trading at nearly 5 times FY2022 EV/EBITDA. At 15 times EBITDA multiple on FY2022, domestic segment accounts for entire market cap, with no value ascribed to the US. Nepexto approval underscores the significant optionality in the pipeline, including the inhalation basket (Fostair in the EU, Spiriva in the US) as well as biosimilars (Neulasta filing in FY2021),"" Kotak said.

Kansai Nerolac | Buy

""We upgrade Kansai Nerolac to buy; even as short-term demand collapses due to COVID-19, fundamentals of the company and the category are notably intact. Volume-led growth potential and stable/improving margin profile arising from rational competition,"" Kotak said.

Kotak cut FY2020-22E forecasts to factor in coronavirus impact, lower crude prices and weaker macros. The stock has corrected 35 percent in the past month notwithstanding significant RM tailwinds and it is trading at 24 times FY2022E PE, implying 40 percent valuation discount to APNT versus 15-20 percent historically.

Brokerage: Motilal Oswal Financial Services

Bharti Airtel | Buy

In the current environment, more tech-savvy data subscribers with higher ARPUs and longer-term recharges of 90 days may see a lower impact, Motilal Oswal said.

However, the rest of feature phone subscribers doing monthly recharges (one-third the ARPU of data subscribers), could see some marginal impact.

To protect these low income subscribers (80m), BHARTI has extended free incoming calls until April 17, 2020, with an additional Rs 10 talk-time.

""This could impact Q1FY21 revenue and EBITDA by Rs 220 crore and Rs 180 crore, respectively, which is equivalent to meager 1-2 percent. Against this, increased data consumption should see upgrades in recharge values, thus, mitigating the impact. In Q4FY20/Q1FY21, we currently estimate 13 percent/19 percent revenue growth on a QoQ basis,"" Motilal said.

Alkem | Buy

With the situation on account of the coronavirus outbreak intensifying, there has been a higher off-take of chronic set of medicines.

Further, with rising cases of cough/cold and respiratory illnesses, there is an increased requirement of antibiotics in the case of Alkem.

With the situation in China easing to some extent with reduced impact of COVID-19, manufacturing of KSM (key starting materials) and intermediates has resumed and moved toward normalcy.

""Alkem is one of the companies with higher exposure (two-thirds of the business) to the domestic formulation, which is a strong industry outperformer. It has lower exposure to US generics (nearly 25 percent), which is driven by new launches,"" Motilal said.

Motilal is positive on Alkem on the back of its industry outperformance track record in domestic formulation and better traction with minimal regulatory risk in US generics.

This has caused markets to de-rate in valuations and also discount a crack in earnings. The accelerated decline in the stock markets in March’20 is probably because of the mounting uncertainty about the duration of the lockdown, globally.

Many governments in conjunction with their respective central banks have deployed a stimulus between 5-10 percent of GDP (estimating the loss in output), due to lockdown measures.

Alongside this, countries are also estimating the economic damage caused by lockdowns to provide equivalent or larger stimulus, so as to minimize hardships faced by citizens. This seems to be the consensus on which, markets are currently working.

The model which is being adopted now, both globally and in India, is to contain the spread, get to know the number of people infected, build healthcare capacity to match infection rates and reduce it to manageable levels.

India is facing a challenge from coronavirus, both socially and economically. Social distancing or suppression strategy, which is in force currently, is likely to yield benefits in slowing down the spread of the virus.

Historically, most economic crises have been caused by excesses in some segments of financial markets, which in turn, have percolated into the economy.

Either it is the central bank’s policy of raising short-term rates too fast or some hot sector crashing after a reality check on expectations or sometimes a reversion to the mean in overall valuations of the markets.

The current crisis, however, is a medical problem that is being tackled by voluntary quarantine that is resulting in a sharp contraction. It is flowing from the economy to markets and not the other way around.

This is also a reason given which, many people expect the economy to witness a sharp recovery, once we get a grip on the virus.

This can be the case, only if and when the lockdown is lifted and the economy is given enough support by the government, to come back online. This remains, a work in progress.

What could we do?

The solution lies in the usage of technology. India has an attractive array of options to use technology to find solutions. The deep penetration of Aadhar, mobile banking, and internet usage, could help authorities in mapping out a solution, containing the spread of the virus.

If we keep aside the moral question of the ‘surveillance state’, because the problem to tackle is about humanity as a whole, we have the required infrastructure to make effective changes.

In specific focus areas or high-risk clusters, the government can use data from mobile phones, social networks or Aadhar, to ascertain citizens’ movements and visit patterns to deploy healthcare professionals to target those who pose highest to lowest risk, in the current scenario.

This can help the government to trace, test and quarantine people in clusters and stop any possibility of community spreads. The government’s effort to get this crisis under control is like fighting a battle on multiple fronts. Healthcare, economic and social aspects, could very well benefit from a powerful dose of technology-led disruption.

Investors could see a sentiment shift once clarity and confidence emerge, of things getting under control, as markets are already offering lucrative valuations.

More than 54 percent of the universe of stocks that we track, are trading in the bottom thirty percentile of valuations, nearing the total decimation last seen in the market crash of 2008.

Such valuation levels should be utilized to up one’s equity preferences in small chunks, during the course of correction. In such times, investors should protect their emotional, financial and intellectual capital, by using a staggered approach to investing. The fruits of such poise in investing, usually are beneficial.

Brokerages are of the view that the industry will take longer than expected to recover fully from the disruption caused by COVID-19.

""Even as the macros of the Indian aviation industry may be in favour of propelling its growth, the industry may not fully recover any time soon post the effects of the pandemic which has affected business operations, travel and tourism and economies world over,"" said CARE Ratings in a note on March 30.

Domestic air traffic growth has been muted at 3.6 percent year-on-year (YoY) to 13.39 crore pax over April 2019-February 2020 due to weak demand. For March 2020, this should further weaken due to travel advisories and then a complete suspension of flights.

The industry, which had already been struggling with the lack of travel demand, is likely to find it difficult to cope with the acute fall in revenue and may be forced to go for measures such as trimming of employee salaries which have already started, brokerages said.

As per brokerage firm Centrum Broking, airlines are taking steps to cut down on costs, for example, IndiGo announced salary cuts ranging from 5-20 percent and Go Air has implemented rotational leaves to employees without pay and. Air India has cancelled and reduced certain allowances it pays to its executive pilots, cabin crew and officers.

Also, as per Centrum, airlines are in talks with the lessors to explore any deferment on lease payments which will support their near term liquidity requirement.

However, going for the airline players is expected to get tougher.

CARE Ratings said that there seems to be turbulence and stormy clouds for the Indian aviation industry as airlines will be operating on sub-par capacity which will result in low ticket booking, fall in revenues and low passenger load factor (PLF).

""Passenger growth of airlines is to fall sharply and register a negative 20-25 percent growth for FY21. Passenger growth has been 13.7 percent during FY19 and 3.7 percent during FY20 (April-February),"" CARE said.

Freight operations may add support to overall traffic movement, CARE believes, but that is also likely to be subdued given the fall slowdown and shutdown of manufacturing units in most parts of the world and in the domestic economy due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""In terms of capital expenditure airlines will be deferring or scaling back on CAPEX given the expected fall in the top line and bottom line of carries which means the purchase of airplanes or adding to the fleet sizes will not take place at least till 9-months-FY21,"" CARE said.

The fall in crude oil prices may also not help much as its benefit would be realised only once operations resume.

Centrum Broking said the interim cut of 11-12 percent in aviation turbine fuel (ATF) prices with effect from March 23 has a little impact with all operations suspended from March 25. Also, the rupee has depreciated by 5.8 percent in Q4FY20E which will increase outgo for dollar-based costs and also result in steep foreign exchange mark-to-market (fx MTM) losses on operating lease liabilities.

Centrum expects IndiGo’s RASK (revenue per available seat kilometre) yields to decline 2.5 percent YoY to Rs 3.5 and expect PAT loss of Rs 1,750 crore, primarily due to fx MTM loss of Rs 1,010 crore. It expects SpiceJet’s RASK yields to decline 3.6 percent YoY to Rs 3.9 and expect PAT loss of Rs 1,050 crore, primarily due to fx MTM loss of Rs 650 crore.

Centrum has a 'buy' recommendation on IndiGo, with a target price of Rs 1,340, and a 'reduce' rating on SpiceJet, with a target price of Rs 33.

There is a possibility of the lockdown being extended beyond April, which will lead to further earnings cuts. In this event, a relief package from the government (interest-free loans, lower taxes, etc) will be critical for the survival of airlines. Aircraft deliveries can also come under pressure as Boeing and Airbus have taken shut-downs, say experts and brokerages.

Brokerage firm Edelweiss Securities expects a weaker yield and passenger load factor (PLF) environment in the first half of FY21 as demand pain will linger.

""Factoring this, we cut FY21/22E EBITDAR 34 percent/18 percent for Indigo and 33 percent/6 percent for SpiceJet. With valuations turning reasonable at 8 times FY22E EV/EBITDAR post 40 percent correction since our downgrade and factoring near-term slowdown, we upgrade Indigo to ‘hold’ from ‘reduce’ with a revised target price of Rs 961 from Rs 1,297 earlier and maintain ‘buy’ on SpiceJet with a revised target price of Rs 79 from Rs 120 earlier,"" Edelweiss said.

Edelweiss added that even though valuations are lower after the recent correction, there is little room for upside at Indigo and advised that investors should avoid the sector at present.

Wherever the equity component has gone down due to the fall in the market, investors should increase their equity exposure while maintaining a balanced allocation, and there can be a slight tilt to largecaps at this time, Sameer Kaul, MD & CEO, Trustplutus, said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.

edited excerpts:

Q) What is your take on the market action amid heavy selling by FIIs? What is causing the panic on D-Street?

A) Broadly speaking selling had come from three sources - FIIs, margin unwinding by brokers and heavy short selling by hedge funds and traders.

We are seeing that the selling pressure by FIIs is abating and margin unwinding by brokers has also reduced substantially.

Therefore, we do not expect such sharp movements on a regular basis going forward. However, the market structure is weak, with share prices falling on modest volumes.

Buying activity by the DII and HNI segment which was till now absorbing FII sale volumes has also moderated.

A) Well, past trends indicate that markets usually retrace some of their losses in the immediate next month following an abnormal fall (like in October/ November 2008). That does give us hope for a positive April series.

However the lockdown will continue till April 15, and the situation is far from normal. At this point, investors should stick to largecap stocks which are most liquid, since there is a real risk that many mid and smallcap companies could become illiquid in the coming months. Liquidity at the bottom of the markets is always at a premium.

Currently, the bottom is placed at around 7,500 on the Nifty. At 7,500 selling abated and there was some buying witnessed across the board. However, markets have the tendency to retest the previous lows which investors should be careful about.

A) The packages announced by the RBI and the government are welcome and much appreciated by the markets. The government has taken steps to protect those at risk and most impacted.

The RBI has done more than what was expected. The government measures may have to be supplemented if the lockdown does not end by the deadline announced or if contagion spreads.

The RBI may also have to take further action specifically on the liquidity front.

Given that growth rates and inflation are likely to collapse, further interest rate cuts are also possible.

The most important policy actions have to happen after the lockdown ends led by massive government spending and a higher fiscal deficit.

A) The saying goes “Prepare and not Predict”. One of the best ways to behave rationally in a challenging time is to pre-commit to your strategy.

We as human beings are bad emotional time travellers, hence, it is always better to have a process-driven decision-making approach that includes a well-articulated Investment Policy Statement.

Once an investor adopts this process his or her approach should be the same in a bullish scenario or a bearish scenario.

Hence, while the checklist should be a logical output of an individual’s Investment Policy Statement, here are some general pointers to a checklist :

a) Investors should be conscious of facts that one should avoid.

b) Investors should not respond to prices & news flow and take a short term decision.

c) Investors should accept the fact that a lot of things we do not know and one should not invest in something that one does not understand.

d) Investors should not change their Investment framework mid-way.

a) Does your current portfolio represent changed facts and reality and is there a course correction required?

b) Apart from asset allocation, the selection of investment should be scrutinized to reflect a new paradigm.

c) Do you understand both qualitative and quantitative risks on the investment opportunity?

d) Does the investment opportunity provide liquidity at a short notice?

e) What is your time preference for the said investment?

Always remember two things: “This too shall pass “ and “Best of the opportunities come in times of crisis, so stay vigilant”

A) The essence of asset allocation is re-balancing.

We would suggest the following thing(s)

a) Plan rebalancing of your asset allocation on March 31.

b) Don’t rush – Take another 6 months to get to the ideal asset allocation. A lot of opportunities may emerge by then.

c) Plug the obvious gaps - We have found that most of the portfolios do not have the desired allocation to gold and international equities.

d) Retain liquidity in the portfolio.

Investors should avoid companies with high leverage,” Mahesh Patil, CIO – Equity, Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC told Moneycontrol.

Well, beaten-down stocks might look attractive because they are available at a considerable discount when compared to the year-back level. But, experts beg to differ.

Not every stock which witnessed selling pressure is an attractive buy. “In a bearish scenario, sector leaders with relatively stronger balance sheets, higher earnings visibility, strong cash flows, and management with a good track record should be preferred. Investors should avoid companies with high leverage,” Mahesh Patil, CIO – Equity, Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC told Moneycontrol.

At one glance, beaten-down stocks could look a better play looking at the valuations but, investors should also focus on factors that led to the fall in specific stocks.

Investors should study the factors which led to the fall – is it because of structural changes in the industry, or is it company-specific issues or FII selling. They should also map the growth potential of the company’s product.

Experts advise investors to commit to their own strategy in times of market turmoil just the ones which we are going through. If you are a disciplined investor, chances are you would be able to invest money at the right time and punch out when things are not looking favourable.

“The saying goes “Prepare and not Predict”. One of the best ways to behave rationally in a challenging time is to pre-commit to your strategy,” Sameer Kaul, MD & CEO, Trustplutus told Moneycontrol.

“We as human beings are bad emotional time travelers and hence it is always better to have a process-driven decision-making approach that include(s) a well-articulated Investment Policy Statement. Once an Investor adopts this process his or her approach should be the same in a bullish scenario or a bearish scenario,” he said.

We spoke to Dinesh Rohira - Founder, CEO - 5nance.com, and here is a list of top 5 factors which he recommends investors to consider while picking beaten-down stocks:

Growth prospects:

In the current environment, there are some businesses that will benefit. These are the companies with products that have non-discretionary demand and low elasticity to price.

Management Dynamism:

Many companies that can change quickly with the times will be at an advantage. Adapting products and services to the environment is key, such that it can benefit consumers.

Valuations:

Across the board, valuations have become reasonable. Still, recent financials can have a bearing on the continuing performance. Sometimes very low valuations can also mean that poor fundamentals are expected to remain or further deteriorate.

De-leveraged Companies:

Companies with lower levels of debt are always in a better position to tide through tough times. They are the ones that have more capacity to survive and change according to the requirement.

Technologically Driven Businesses:

Many companies implement technology to their advantage. It is even more critical during such times as social distancing could mean more virtual dependence.

20,"April 03, 2020 10:42 AM IST",1,Kshitij Anand,Last 10-year data suggests April belongs to bulls; will 2020 be different?,"Data from the last 10 years suggest that bulls got an upper hand seven times in the month of April.
On the other hand, Nifty fell three times in April in the last 10 years — in 2015 (Nifty down over 3 percent), 2012 (Nifty down 0.90 percent) and 2011 (Nifty down 0.6 percent).
After losing more than Rs 30 lakh crore of investor's wealth in March, traders and investors are hoping for some stability in markets.
FII Activity:Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have pulled out more than Rs 65,000 crore from the cash segment of the Indian equity markets in March, as per provisional data.
On the other hand, mutual funds were mostly net sellers in the last ten years in the month of April.","Nifty50 jumped over 6 percent in April 2018, followed by 4.3 percent in April 2013 and over 1.48 percent in April 2016 — three of the biggest gains in April in the last 10 years.","March turned out to be an absolute disaster for the D-Street. The benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty50 dropped about 23 percent each and slipped into bear territory.

Now, as we step into April, investors are hopeful that the worst is behind us. But, given the continued exponential rise in COVID-19 cases in India and across the world, recovery may still be some time away despite a slew of measures undertaken by the central bankers around the globe.

Data from the last 10 years suggest that bulls got an upper hand seven times in the month of April.

Nifty50 jumped over 6 percent in April 2018, followed by 4.3 percent in April 2013 and over 1.48 percent in April 2016 — three of the biggest gains in April in the last 10 years.

On the other hand, Nifty fell three times in April in the last 10 years — in 2015 (Nifty down over 3 percent), 2012 (Nifty down 0.90 percent) and 2011 (Nifty down 0.6 percent).

Experts feel that the trend of the market will be driven by institutional activity, especially foreign investors who have pulled out more than Rs 60,000 crore from the cash segment of Indian markets and rise in coronavirus cases across the world including India.

“It is very tough to make a call for April after a brutal fall in March series because there are still lots of uncertainty about COVID-19 where the market has discounted almost worst-case scenario including a lockdown of 21-Days but if the situation further deteriorates from here then the market will again adjust itself in the downside,” Amit Gupta, Co-Founder & CEO, TradingBells told Moneycontrol.

“We can say that the April is going to be very choppy with moves on both sides, unlike March where the market has fallen vertically,” he said.

After losing more than Rs 30 lakh crore of investor's wealth in March, traders and investors are hoping for some stability in markets.

History suggests that markets have usually bounced back after steep moves on the downside. Hence, the swing low of 7,511 recorded on 24 March could act as a near-term bottom in April – only if there is no sudden spike in COVID-19 cases or selling from FIIs continues.

“Well, past trends indicate that in the months following an abnormal fall, markets usually retrace some of their losses in the immediate next month (like in October/ November 2008). That does give us hope for a positive April series,” Sameer Kaul, MD & CEO, Trustplutus told Moneycontrol.

“Currently, there is a bottom at a place at around 7,500 on the Nifty. At 7,500 selling abated and there was some buying witnessed across the board. However, markets have the tendency to retest the previous lows which investors should be careful about,” he said.

FII Activity:

Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have pulled out more than Rs 65,000 crore from the cash segment of the Indian equity markets in March, as per provisional data.

“The large sell-off by FIIs due to increased volatility is largely over. Some amount of selling will continue until we see signs of flattening of the virus infection curve. DIIs, on the other hand, have seen good inflows in this month till date as investors and asset allocation funds move more money to equities seeing the markets at attractive levels,” Mahesh Patil, CO CIO Equities, Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund told Moneycontrol.

“However, if the lockdown is prolonged and the impact on the economy is much more severe, the savings will get impacted and the domestic flows could slow down,” he said.

If we look at the historical data, they have been mostly net buyers in the last 10 years in April. FIIs were net buyers of equities worth nearly Rs 20,000 crore in April 2019, followed by Rs 9,700 crore inflows in April 2010, and Rs 8,702 crore inflows recorded in April 2015.

On the other hand, mutual funds were mostly net sellers in the last ten years in the month of April. They pulled out more than Rs 5,000 crore in April 2019, followed by Rs 2,600 crore selloff in April 2014, and over Rs 1,600 crore in April 2010.

Solid business model and brands which are leaders in industry, products or niche segment, Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.

edited excerpts:

Q) After an unforgettable March, do you think markets will be able to bounce back given the measures introduced by the govt?

A) To bounce back we need to see the number of infected cases coming down. In the near-term, the market may reverse from a sharp bounce led by huge fiscal and monetary measures announced.

These measures will not be able to pick-up the economy in the short-term unless we see successful lockdown and reduction in the spread of COVID-19.

A) The data suggests that we have entered a recession phase and the stock prices have factored that. This stock market trend will continue to be challenging if the risk of recession remains after the 21-day lockdown.

If the lockdown of 21-Days in India becomes successful and the domestic market opens then the second half of April will be promising. At the same time, recovery from a global lockdown will be encouraging.

A) Assuming that this health problem will be around more than three months, the total size of the fiscal, as well as monetary stimulus, is good enough as it accounts to about 4 percent of India's GDP.

The scheme has factored free food, an increase in cash in hand, job safety, loan, and various steps. The RBI announced monetary stimulus to increase financial liquidity and reduce risk in the system by providing a huge cut in interest rate and cash reserve ratio, moratorium and working capital interest deferment for three months, OMO and other relaxation which will provide liquidity of 3.2 percent of GDP, which is massive.

At the same time, the global economy needs to recover in those three months, else we are in a challenging situation.

A) This will be positive for defensive and staple business like FMCG, given the support to the rural and semi-rural economy. Banks will also benefit from the relaxation in the classification of NPA, higher incomes and reduction in interest cost. In general, any business that focuses on the domestic economy will benefit.

A) Here is a list of top three stocks which could turn out to be the biggest wealth creators:

Business operations are largely domestic and on account of the sharp fall in crude oil prices, the cost of the key raw materials has come down which would result in a significant improvement in margins for paint companies.

Furthermore, the companies are likely to pass the benefit to customers to set the brush for a revival in demand. Rising urbanisation and the government's stimulus measures will help to increase demand in the long term.

The packaged food (biscuit) industry is currently facing supply chain issues rather than demand issues due to lock down on account of COVID-19 pandemic.

Once the situation stabilises, we believe Britannia would be one of the major beneficiary considering the factors such as essential food category products, negligible dependence on exports (6%), strong distribution network (55 lakh outlets), negligible debt (D/E of 0.04x) & good cash position (Rs850 crore as on FY19) and strong return ratios (RoE of 24% and RoCE of 29% as on FY19).

It is at a sweet spot with almost no balance sheet stress unlike its competitors with good asset quality, lower exposure to stressed corporate lenders and low NPA below 0.5. Strong digital capabilities and high exposure in semi-urban and rural segments to add profitability once the economy is back to normalcy with CAR of 18.5.

A) Focus on domestic-oriented companies, businesses that stay safe and flourish during and after challenges. Solid business model and brands which are leaders in industry, products or niche segment.

Healthy track record of existence and ability to flourish under any cycle of the economy. Solid cash flow generation and lucrative dividend pay-out. A healthy balance sheet with zero/negligible net-debt.

Credible management, no pledging and strong shareholding of recognised institutions. Attractive valuation and parameters like business growth, margin, RoE, and RoI.

A) We had suggested increasing the mix of quality mid and smallcap at the start of the year based on a promising outlook for 2020. This is unlikely to happen anytime soon as the economy will have to suffer a recession.

Given the change in view, we suggest allocation of 30 percent for top private banks, top NBFCs and PSUB (not more than 5 finance stocks). The next 25 percent should be on consumption, chemicals and pharma.

Rest could be stock specific with a focus on IT, companies with management credentials, clean fundamentals, dividend history and a healthy business outlook with leadership qualities. Spread your investment in time, stocks and sectors.

Stick with quality stocks having leadership in sector, products or niche segment. Don’t be lured by low prices like new lows, 52-week low or a bounce in price during such consolidation period. Capitulation is not an opportunity to buy any type of stock.

Automotive replacement segment forms 38-49 percent of total revenues and 55-70 percent of EBITDA for Exide and Amara Raja respectively.

The brokerage believes steep correction in the stock prices does not factor in the steady nature of automotive replacement demand.

Amara Raja shares rallied 8.5 percent and Exide Industries gained 4.3 percent on March 31, after falling 44 percent and 38 percent respectively in last more than two months due to coronavirus-led sell-off.

Also, the COVID-19 forced the government to announced 21-day lockdown last week, which will have a major impact on earnings of these companies.

""We expect near-term demand scenario to remain challenging for Amara Raja Batteries and Exide Industries given the 21-day nationwide lockdown the country is under. However, we believe Amara Raja and Exide Industries are well-placed to recover some part of lost revenues as replacement demand will likely come back post the lockdown,"" said Kotak.

Automotive replacement segment forms 38-49 percent of total revenues and 55-70 percent of EBITDA for Exide and Amara Raja respectively. Even during the 2008 global crisis, both Amara Raja and Exide Industries gross revenues grew by 17 percent YoY in FY2009 and 7 percent YoY in FY2010 mainly led by strong auto replacement segment demand.

""Also, organized players like Amara Raja and Exide Industries with strong balance sheets are benefitting from gaining market share from the unorganized segment,"" said the brokerage.

Hence, Kotak expects Amara Raja revenues to grow by 5 percent CAGR over FY2019-22 led by (1) 7-10 percent revenue CAGR in 2-wheeler and 4-wheeler replacement segment, (2) 13 percent revenue CAGR in e-rickshaw segment and (3) 5 percent revenue CAGR in railways segments.

In case of Exide Industries, the brokerage expects revenues to grow by 1 percent CAGR over FY2019-22 led by (1) 3-8 percent revenue CAGR in 2W and 4W replacement segment, (2) 12 percent revenue CAGR in the submarine and e-rickshaw segment and (3) 3 percent revenue CAGR in UPS segment.

However, Kotak slashed its price target for Amara Raja to Rs 650 (from Rs 780 earlier) and Exide Industries to Rs 165 (from Rs 180) due to cut in EPS estimates amid COVID-19-led impact.

The brokerage has cut Amara Raja's FY2021-22 EPS estimates by 13-16 percent led by (1) 10-12 percent cut in revenue growth assumptions mainly in the OEM and industrial segments and (2) 20-30 bps cut in EBITDA margin assumptions.

It has cut Exide Industries' FY2021-22 EPS estimates by 7-20 percent led by (1) 10-12 percent cut in revenue growth assumptions mainly in OEM and industrial segments and (2) 100 bps cut in EBITDA margin assumptions.

Kotak has reduced its EBITDA margin assumptions for Amara Raja by 20-30 bps and Exide Industries by 50-100 bps only over FY2020-22E due to (1) duopoly nature of the industry with high pricing power in the replacement segment (B2C business), which has a fragmented customer base and (2) steep decline in lead prices over the past three months given global growth concerns on account of coronavirus pandemic offset by negative operating leverage.

Lead prices have corrected by 10 percent YoY (in USD terms) and 7 percent YoY (in INR terms) in Q4FY20.

Kotak believes the company will be able to retain most of the lower lead prices in the replacement segment, which will aid gross margins in the near-term.

Amara Raja Batteries was up Rs 33.35 or 7.40 percent at Rs 483.90 and Exide Industries gained Rs 3.95 or 3.11 percent at Rs 130.80 on the BSE at 1306 hours IST.

The outbreak of COVID-19 will hit India's already struggling automobile sector significantly and brokerages warn that the sector may take longer than expected to recover from the blow.

Brokerages highlight that the industry sales volumes are down nearly 16 percent so far in FY20. The auto industry was readying for the transition for the upcoming switchover to BS-VI norms with effect from April 1, 2020, that needed intense deliberation and strategising in areas related to products, pricing, production & inventory management. The outbreak of coronavirus has come as a serious blow.

A report by brokerage firm ICICI Direct stated that SIAM's (Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers) estimates had shown the present suspension of production activities at OEMs and ancillaries would cost the industry nearly Rs 2,300 crore per day in lost revenues.

""Q4FY20 (till March 15) was witness to production rationalisation at most OEMs as the focus remained firmly on the rundown of BS-IV stock. With half of March slated to be a washout, the quarter is another poor one,"" said ICICI Direct.

ICICI Direct expects industry volumes to decline sharply (nearly 40-50 percent) in Q1FY21E amid plant closures, accounting for at least two months of subnormal operations (one month of complete closure i.e. April 2020 and corresponding one month of gradual resumption of work i.e. May 2020).

""Our reworked estimates bake in another year of de-growth at the industry level in FY21E (-5 percent), after adjusting for some pent up recovery in the second half of FY21E. We see meaningful growth returning to the industry only in FY22E post normalisation of BS-VI environment, expected uptick in economic activity and consumer spending and build in nearly 10 percent volume increase for that year,"" ICICI Direct said.

As per the estimates of the brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services, in March 2020, wholesale volumes are estimated to decline nearly 37 percent, 40 percent and 68 percent year-on-year (YoY) for 2Ws, PVs and CVs, respectively, due to lockdown and BS-VI transition. Tractors volumes are expected to decline by about 16 percent YoY.

The stocks are now available at cheaper valuations and brokerages see it as an opportunity to buy quality stocks from the sector.

""Valuations appear attractive but given the uncertain macro environment and the threat of possible prolonged impact of coronavirus, we prefer stocks offering higher visibility of demand recovery, better competitive positioning, the scope of higher operating leverage and strong balance sheet,"" said Motilal Oswal.

As per Edelweiss Securities, after the sharp correction in stock prices, valuations have turned favourable despite the near-term uncertainty as the structural story is intact (demand as well as free cash flow generation) and pricing discipline will ensure benefits of easing commodities will be retained.

Stock recommendations from the sector

ICICI Direct said at this juncture, its preference from the sector are those business models that are capital efficient in nature (RoE, RoCE of more than 15 percent), possess healthy balance sheet (debt: equity less than 0.5 times) and are more domestic (India) centric in nature.

""We maintain our view that these businesses remain better placed to navigate the current downturn effectively and emerge stronger from it, leaving themselves primed for eventual recovery down the road. Among OEMs, we have valuation comfort and assign 'buy' ratings to Hero MotoCorp, Mahindra & Mahindra, Bajaj Auto and Ashok Leyland while assigning 'hold' rating to Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors, Eicher Motors and Escorts,"" ICICI Direct said.

Among ancillaries, ICICI Direct has a 'buy' rating to Exide Industries and 'hold' ratings to Apollo Tyres and Bharat Forge.

Edelweiss Securities said it preferred stocks which have, or can have, strong product cycle and margin tailwinds.

Tata Motors, Eicher Motors and Hero MotoCorp are its top picks from the sector.

""We prefer Tata Motors which is a ‘buy’, as it is on the cusp of a strong product cycle. Moreover, the recent GBP depreciation will favour the company as it has a higher exposure to China and can benefit from its revival,"" Edelweiss said.

""Hero MotoCorp is a play on rural demand with attractive valuations. However, our structural concerns on its ability to gain market share in scooters, premium motorcycles and export persist,"" said Edelweiss.

""Eicher Motors' new product cycle can catapult, not only domestic volumes but also exports,"" said Edelweiss.

We have enhanced a deposit category by 25 bps to accelerate this,"" IndusInd Bank said.
The stock price has corrected steeply in recent days, owing to concerns about asset quality and strength of funding franchise.
IIFL believes this will force IndusInd Bank to cut back growth and impact NIMs.
ICICI Securities has a “buy” recommendation on IndusInd Bank but with a target price of Rs 1,268 against Rs 1,796 earlier.","Some reduction in wholesale, possibly attributable to stock price fall is also a reason behind the fall in deposits.","Shares of IndusInd Bank hit 15 percent lower circuit at Rs 349.85 in the early trade on BSE on March 31, a day after the private lender said its deposits were down by around 11 percent.

Of the total fall in deposits since Q3FY20, 70 percent was through state government deposits and 30 percent was via corporate deposits.

""Deposits fell 10-11 percent and almost two-third of reduction is on account of government-related accounts – this is largely related to general private sector bank stance. This will also result in lower CASA ratio, but reduce our dependency on this category for deposits in future,"" IndusInd Bank said in a regulatory filing on BSE on March 30.

Some reduction in wholesale, possibly attributable to stock price fall is also a reason behind the fall in deposits. The retail reduction is least, the bank said and claimed that deposits are more stable and flows recommenced while NIMs are also expected to remain stable.

""Deposit traction will rebuild in April. The bank has an aggressive deposit retailisation strategy in place. LCR-based retail deposit base growing more than 40 percent, significantly ahead of peers. We have enhanced a deposit category by 25 bps to accelerate this,"" IndusInd Bank said.

The stock price has corrected steeply in recent days, owing to concerns about asset quality and strength of funding franchise.

The coronavirus outbreak has further impacted growth and asset-quality prospects in the select business segments.

Tough road ahead

The bank said it has replaced the bulk of these deposits by CDs and borrowings. This, as per brokerage firm Emkay Global, should inch up funding cost in the near-term, weighing in on margins.

Besides, the brokerage said the bank plans to focus on retail deposits (via expanding branches), which will take time to build and thus credit growth will be calibrated, tracking deposit momentum and not vice versa, as it happened in the past.

""The bank has seen deterioration in asset quality due to corporate slippage, which we believe will accelerate after the recent lockdown, led by stress in retail and SME and some lumpy corporate stress (for e.g., Vodafone). Thus, we build in higher NPAs at 3.1 percent/LLP (loan loss provision) at 170 bps in FY21E,"" Emkay Global said.

The bank plans to rebalance its book towards consumer banking, which should lead to margin or RoA expansion in the long run, Emkay said.

The bank has said cards, personal loans, real estate and loan against property (LAP) are showing early signs of disruption, while diamond and CV portfolios are well-tested across cycles with higher customer vintage and should bounce back as normalcy returns.

Moreover, the bank believes that the RBI moratorium of three months should help manage this temporary disruption unless the situation worsens.

Emkay Global said that near-term growth and asset quality pain will weigh on stock performance, but the new MD’s strategy to focus on retailisation of assets and liabilities should help the bank in the long run.

The brokerage has a “buy” recommendation on the stock, with a revised target price of Rs 630, valuing the bank at 1.1 times FY21E ABV/1 time FY22E ABV. Emkay said the key risks to its call are higher-than-expected NPA formation and a further deceleration in loan growth.

Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services, too, has a “buy” on the stock, with a target price of Rs 800.

""We estimate credit cost to remain elevated over the next few quarters while lower our business growth assumptions. We thus cut our FY20 and FY21 earnings by 13 percent and 22 percent, respectively, and estimate the bank to deliver FY21E RoA and RoE of 1.7 percent and 14.3 percent, respectively. We reduce our target price to Rs 800 which corresponds to 1.3 times forward ABV,"" Motilal Oswal said.

IIFL Securities, too, has a “buy” call on the stock, with a target price of Rs 650.

IIFL said that while the fall in deposits has been replaced by other sources, it exposes the bank’s tight liquidity situation.

IIFL believes this will force IndusInd Bank to cut back growth and impact NIMs. IndusInd is in the process of accelerating stressed-asset recognition and provisions too.

""Given this and the Covid-19 related impact, we downgrade profits by 6.5/26/14 percent for FY20/21/22ii, respectively. We believe IndusInd Bank would trade at 1 time FY22ii BVPS due to uncertain growth and profitability outlook for now,"" IIFL Securities said.

ICICI Securities has a “buy” recommendation on IndusInd Bank but with a target price of Rs 1,268 against Rs 1,796 earlier.

""Despite some concerns on stressed telecom account, higher vehicle book and uncertainty around COVID-19, we believe IndusInd Bank is a good value proposition given it is trading at 0.9 timrs P/ABV FY21E,"" ICICI Securities said.

ICICI said the impact on asset quality may be for a short term. However, it will be important to track borrowers' behaviour after the completion of moratorium period, it said. As per the brokerage, working capital loans and unsecured loans like personal loans and credit cards are at higher risk of default.

We spoke to various experts and collated a list of stocks that are likely to benefit the most from the stimulus package announced by the govt.
Expert: ICICIdirectHDFC Bank:HDFC Bank has efficiently focused on retail business and has garnered strong liability franchise to yield superior profitability over the years.
Such high CASA limits the cost of funds and thereby enables to report of superior NIM above 4 percent consistently.
The same has safeguarded the bank from NPA issues faced by the industry in recent fiscals.",Experts feel that the coming few months are expected to be difficult as all financial markets have witnessed a swift meltdown thereby opening up opportunities for long term investors to dip in.,"The Finance Minister and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) last week unleashed a slew of measures to cushion the impact of the economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 outbreak.

Indian market which is now in the bear phase will find it difficult to get back on its feet in the near to medium term but stock-specific action is likely to continue.

Within a couple of days of the announcement of the 21-day lockdown across the country, the govt. and the RBI have made some major announcements to cushion the impact of the economic crash.

Various economists and analysts suggest that the COVID-19 outbreak will significantly impact the Indian economy. UBS forecasts India's GDP growth could be 2.5 percent, while in a more severe pandemic scenario it could be negative, at -0.2 percent on a YoY basis in FY21.

According to Emkay Global, the lockdown of the nature we are going through should shave off Rs 2.3 lakh crore from GDP every week it is continued.

“Although the govt's Rs1.7-lakh crore package (0.83% of GDP) addresses some of the most basic issues, it pales in comparison with both the scale of the problem and what is being done by other countries,” it said.

The noteworthy measures include free food grains and pulses, cash transfers to widows, elderly and women, and free LPG for three months.

Indeed, the RBI's announcement of loan moratorium should be seen as a logistically faster and more efficient way of alleviating immediate cash flow needs of the economy – but coming at the cost of banks’ profitability.

Experts feel that the coming few months are expected to be difficult to navigate as global trade has dwindled and all financial markets have witnessed a swift meltdown thereby opening up opportunities for long term investors to dip in.

“On a historical basis, we believe broader markets have coincided with long term averages currently, which does not surely indicate a bottom. However, at the same time it has started throwing up opportunities in the large-cap/midcap space,” ICICIdirect said in a report.

“In the current milieu, some of the large and best-managed companies are available at attractive valuations on a historical basis. Hence, in our view, one should venture out and accumulate companies, which have gone through such challenging cycles and have come out much stronger when such events subside,” the report added.

We spoke to various experts and collated a list of stocks that are likely to benefit the most from the stimulus package announced by the govt. & stocks which could offer stable returns:

Expert: Naveen Kulkarni, Chief Investment Officer, Axis Securities Limited

Bharti Airtel:

The need for telecommunication has increased significantly because of lockdowns. The revenues in the prepaid segment could be impacted as daily wage earners may not recharge their phone but data consumption will increase further.

Thus the overall revenue and earnings impact will be limited. Thus, a good time to accumulate telecom stocks.

TCS:

It is the largest IT company that has solid cash balance and developed countries are likely to come out of lockdowns ahead of India. While order flows will reduce but rupee depreciation could help.

RBI's significant rate cut means that rupee is more likely to depreciate further. Thus TCS is a good defensive bet in this market.

HDFC Bank:

HDFC Bank has efficiently focused on retail business and has garnered strong liability franchise to yield superior profitability over the years. Seasoned portfolio and management experience led to higher than industry advances growth at 24 percent CAGR in FY08-19.

Advances were at Rs 9.3 lakh crore as of December 2019, with major traction towards the retail book. Enriched customer experience, a strong network of 5345 branches and a focus on digitisation has enabled building a strong liability franchise with CASA comprising 40 percent of deposits.

Such high CASA limits the cost of funds and thereby enables to report of superior NIM above 4 percent consistently. Prudent asset quality has been core to the bank. The same has safeguarded the bank from NPA issues faced by the industry in recent fiscals.

After witnessing a steep cut in the previous session, the Indian market bounced back sharply on March 31, tracking firm global markets.

The Nifty reclaimed 8,575 this week after some lower-level buying was witnessed in heavyweights like Reliance Industries, HDFC twins and Infosys.

However, on the technical front, the Nifty and the Nifty Bank indices are still trading in a bearish channel and on the higher side, 8,800-9,000 zone for the Nifty while 19,500-20,000 zone for the Bank Nifty should act as a strong hurdle.

On the derivatives front, put writers were seen adding open interest at 8,400 and 8,500 strikes, which should provide some support to the market.

Till then, we can expect some stock-specific action along with some volatility in a broader range of 8,400-9,000 in the coming few sessions.

Here are three stock recommendations for the next 3-4 weeks:

CESC | Buy | LTP: Rs 407 | Target price: Rs 465 | Stop loss: Rs 365 | Upside: 14 percent

For the last two months, the stock has been beaten down as the prices have witnessed a sharp fall from Rs 700 towards Rs 370 levels.

On the technical front, however, the stock has tested its 200-day exponential moving average on monthly charts and bounced back sharply to reclaim above-Rs 400 level in a week’s time.

At the current juncture, some consolidation can be seen from the last four-five sessions and also the stock has formed a Doji star pattern on the daily charts.

The secondary oscillators are suggesting a bounce into the prices, as the stock has also given a breakout above the falling trendline of a sloping channel on a shorter timeframe.

Traders can accumulate the stock in the Rs 400-410 range for the upside target of Rs 465 with a stop loss below Rs 365.

Hindustan Unilever (HUL) | Buy | LTP: Rs 2,298.50 | Target price: Rs 2,670 | Stop loss: Rs 2,050 | Upside: 16 percent

After witnessing a steep fall from Rs 2,250 to Rs 1,800, the stock saw a V-shape recovery and made a new 52-week high on March 31.

The stock has once again surpassed its short and long-term moving averages on broader charts as well, with some long build-up into the prices.

The V-shape recovery has been seen with marginally higher volumes, which suggests a further up move in the coming sessions as well.

Traders can accumulate the stock in the Rs 2,270-2,290 range for the upside target of Rs 2,670 with a stop loss below Rs 2,050.

Nestle India | Buy | LTP: Rs 16,272.95 | Target price: Rs 18,370 | Stop loss: Rs 14,000 | Upside: 13 percent

In recent weeks, this stock has also given almost a V-shape recovery after testing 100-day exponential moving average on the weekly charts.

Despite the weak market sentiment, the stock has shown strength from the lower levels as recovery was seen with some heavy volumes, which suggests long build-up into the prices.

At the current juncture, however, the stock is facing immediate resistance at Rs 16,800 but positive divergences on secondary oscillators suggest that the stock can move beyond its 52-week high of Rs 16,835 in the coming sessions.

Traders can accumulate the stock on dips in the range of Rs 15,850-15,700 for the upside target of Rs 18,370 with a stop loss below Rs 14,000.

But, the current scenario, in contrast, poses multiple challenges, implying a more enduring effect on demand potentially extending to medium term (12-18 months).

“It is possible that rich valuations do pose challenges as most stocks in the coverage are still trading at mid-cycle/lower end of the peak cycle. Only a few possess levers to outperform in a tough demand outlook,” said the report.

Out of the coverage universe, Edelweiss Securities reiterated their conviction for: a) Voltas - sustained leadership in RACs and potential to scale up the refrigerator business (JV), b) KEI - earnings growth resilience and balance sheet discipline.

Most of the companies which are part of the index are bluechip names and are leaders of their respective sectors. With the recent fall seen in the markets, many of the blue-chip names are trading at multi-year lows.

The question now is – are these stocks good long-term buys? Moneycontrol spoke to experts on this and they said, not all stocks which have hit their 52-week lows are long term buys, but only a select few.

Some of the stocks which are going through a turmoil are due to structural or industry-specific issues, hence, it does make sense to avoid while some of them are under pressure due to institutional selling.

It makes a valid case for investors who are looking at an investment horizon of 2-3 years. Because the volatility is likely to continue amid the Coronavirus outbreak at least till the time a medically approved vaccine comes to light.

“Investor, looking to build long term portfolio, can start investing in blue chips companies such as Reliance Industries, HDFC twins, Bajaj finance, Asian paints, Colgate, Britannia, Dabur, L&T, Axis Bank, Titan, Cipla, Infosys and TCS which are available at a reasonable valuation,” Ajit Mishra, VP Research, Religare Broking told Moneycontrol.

“Though we do not rule out further downside in the stock price due to on-going virus concern and its impact on the economy, we would advise buying these fundamentally sound stocks in a phased manner for healthy returns over the next 2-3 years,” he said.

Experts do advise caution on the part of investors before making a buy or a sell decision. Positions in quality stocks can be made in a staggered manner keeping in view the risk profile of investor(s) in order to avoid opportunity loss, suggest experts.

“Markets are in grip of risk aversion due to the spread of coronavirus pandemic. Though the stocks have corrected significantly from their highs, the uncertainty involved in the markets has not abated given the escalation of new cases and causalities due to the virus esp. in the US and Europe,” Pankaj Bobade, Fundamental Research head, Axis Securities Limited told Moneycontrol.

“If one has more than 3 years of investment horizon, one can look at investing in the corrected blue chips in staggered manner thereby averaging the cost of acquisition,” he said.

The large part of the fall was led by consistent selling by foreign investors who have pulled out more than Rs 60,000 crore from Indian equity markets from the cash segment so far in March, provisional data showed.

With 21 days of lockdown in India and a complete halt of economic activity across the globe due to rising cases of COVID-19 has fueled fears of economic recession, one of its worst seen in the last 150 years.

In an exclusive interview with CNBC-Tv18, former IMF chief economist Kenneth Rogoff said that “We are going to have a giant recession this year. The depth of the recession will be lot large at the high end of the 100 worst recessions the whole world has experienced in the last 150 years,” he said.

In tandem with the global markets, D-Street witnessed one of its worst month in the last 12 years. More than 90 percent of the Nifty50 stocks hit a fresh 52-week low or multi-year lows in the same period.

Relief measures from Govt:

To battle the pandemic, the Indian government along with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) have unleashed slew of measures to cushion the slowdown caused by the lockdown in the country for 21-Days, however, experts feel that more such measured could come in to support the economy.

“The Indian government is tackling the COVID-19 situation in a step-by-step manner. The government has already announced a 21-day lockdown in an attempt to stop the spread of the virus. They have announced relief measures worth Rs 1.7 lakh crore targeted to the low-income segment,” Mahesh Patil, CIO – Equity, Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC told Moneycontrol.

“Overall, these measures should give some confidence to investors that India should be able to contain the virus sooner rather than later. However, in comparison to other economies like US, Europe and China, where a very large stimulus of almost 8-10% of GDP has been announced, we need to do more,” he said.

The RBI also reduced rates by 75 bps, announced measures which will enhance liquidity in the system by 3.7 lakh crore, as well as a moratorium on loan and interest payments which should provide relief to a large swath of the population.

What should investors do?

Well, it looks like markets have factored in the worst, going by experts. But, if cases related to Coronavirus escalate the Nifty could retest the recent swing low of 7,511 recorded on March 24.

In case we breach 7511 in April the possibility of further decline towards 7300, and 7000 looks likely, but the current scenario is a good opportunity for long term investors to build a portfolio.

“The data suggests that we are in a recession for CY2020 and the stock prices has factored that. This stock market trend will continue to be challenging if the risk of recession is expanding even post lockdown,” Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told Moneycontrol.

“If the lockdown of 21days in India becomes successful and the domestic market opens then the second part of April will be promising. At the same time recovery from global lockdown will be encouraging,” he said.

Sameer Paul, MD & CEO, Trustplutus suggests that investors should stick to large-cap stocks which are most liquid since there is a real risk that many mid and small-cap companies could become illiquid in the coming months. Liquidity at the bottom of the markets is always at a premium.

""Currently there is a bottom at a place at around 7,500 on the Nifty. At 7,500 selling abated and there was some buying witnessed across the board. However, markets have the tendency to retest the previous lows which investors should be careful about,"" he said.

In a statement published on March 29, the US Department of Health and Human Services detailed recent donations of medicine to a national stockpile, including chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, both being investigated as potential COVID-19 treatments.

It said the FDA had allowed them ""to be distributed and prescribed by doctors to hospitalised teen and adult patients with COVID-19, as appropriate, when a clinical trial is not available or feasible.""

US Presient Donald Trump said last week that the two drugs could be a ""gift from God"", despite scientists warning against the dangers of overhyping unproven treatments.

19,"March 31, 2020 03:53 PM IST",2,Sunil Matkar,Bharti Airtel share price up 4% as Motilal Oswal sees 44% upside on strong ARPU,"Bharti Airtel share price gained 4 percent intraday on March 31, as Motilal Oswal retained a 'buy' call on likely strong average revenue per user (ARPU) which has not been captured in the stock price yet.
With physical recharges being unavailable, there has been a shift to digital recharges (from 15 percent in the last 1-2 years to 35-40 percent currently),"" said Motilal Oswal.
Against this, increased data consumption should see upgrades in recharge values, thus, mitigating the impact,"" said Motilal Oswal, which estimated 13/19 percent revenue growth in Q4FY20/Q1FY21, on QoQ basis.
According to Motilal Oswal, the sharp reduction in crude prices could result in revenue softness in the short term, particularly in Nigeria, Congo and Chad.
However, Motilal Oswal expects the potential restoration of the past era (2G) when telcos had the opportunity to monetize investments for a prolonged period.","Motilal Oswal sees limited impact of COVID-19, currency and crude price swings on the Bharti stock and believes that it is the best hedged to face regulatory woes.","Bharti Airtel share price gained 4 percent intraday on March 31, as Motilal Oswal retained a 'buy' call on likely strong average revenue per user (ARPU) which has not been captured in the stock price yet.

The stock has fallen around 20 percent from its peak following the coronavirus outbreak and the 21-day lockdown in India to check the spread of virus.

But, the impact of the outbreak and the currency and crude price swing would be limited, as the company was best hedged to face regulatory woes, it said.

""Given the complete lockdown in India due to COVID-19, net subscriber adds (average 2-3 months) have stalled thus impacted by 1-2 percent. With physical recharges being unavailable, there has been a shift to digital recharges (from 15 percent in the last 1-2 years to 35-40 percent currently),"" said Motilal Oswal.

""In the current environment, more tech-savvy data subscribers with higher ARPUs and longer-term recharges of 90 days may see lower impact. However, the rest of feature phone subscribers doing monthly recharges (one-third the ARPU of data subscribers) could see some marginal impact.""

To protect the low-income subscribers (80 million), Bharti had extended free incoming calls to April 17, with an additional Rs 10 talk time.

""This could impact Q1FY21 revenue/EBITDA by Rs 220/180 crore ie equivalent to meager 1-2 percent. Against this, increased data consumption should see upgrades in recharge values, thus, mitigating the impact,"" said Motilal Oswal, which estimated 13/19 percent revenue growth in Q4FY20/Q1FY21, on QoQ basis.

The brokerage said the sharp depreciation in the rupee against the dollar should increase Bharti's USD capex/debt and put some of its African business under stress. But it does not expect a meaningful impact.

The dollar denominated India capex by Bharti is around 30 percent. Thus, 10 percent rupee depreciation could have around 3 percent increase, the research firm said.

Similarly, around 28 percent of its debt is dollar denominated, while India debt is 15 percent.

According to Motilal Oswal, the sharp reduction in crude prices could result in revenue softness in the short term, particularly in Nigeria, Congo and Chad. However, Bharti's free cash flow (FCF) positive position and lower leverage should have limited impact, said the brokerage.

Bharti remained in a win-win situation, irrespective of the Supreme Court's outcome on Vodafone Idea's fortunes, it said.

The government has been pitching for a healthy telecom market (3 private and 1 PSU player), which accentuates the need for Vodafone to stay afloat.

However, Vodafone Idea's survival would require a sharp ARPU increase (potentially over 30 percent) along with a moratorium on payments to service its

regulatory and debt obligations, which could also benefit Bharti, Motilal Oswal said.

Even in the worst-case scenario of no government support on AGR dues, the brokerage, said Bharti's financial position was strong enough to withstand the storm, and in fact, could lead to significant market share gain at the cost of Vodafone Idea.

In either case, Bharti could deliver a marked rise in earnings, it said. ""We see potential increase of around 39 percent in FY22 EBITDA estimate to Rs 62,100 crore.""

Over the last decade, Bharti has been saddled with high capex, spectrum acquisition cost and depressed EBITDA, which suppressed its FCF.

However, Motilal Oswal expects the potential restoration of the past era (2G) when telcos had the opportunity to monetize investments for a prolonged period.

""With a large part of the heavy lifting toward 4G network in place, incremental capex should be in check, while EBITDA should see a marked improvement. This should provide an opportunity to deleverage the balance sheet. Subsequently, we expect FCF (post interest) to increase to over Rs 30,000 crore in FY22 (if EBITDA grows to Rs 62,100 crore) from Rs 2,500 crore in FY20 and negative in FY19,"" it said.

The stock ended the day at Rs 440.6, up Rs 11.35, or 2.64 percent, on the BSE.

The Nifty has already corrected 37 percent since 17 January, compared to 35 percent for Global Emerging Markets and 30 percent for Asia, but the risk-to-reward ratio has turned attractive now.

India’s COVID-19 response measures have arguably been proactive, even as the number of officially confirmed cases has remained low, UBS Securities India said in a report.

“The fall in the markets reflects concerns around India’s high population density and relatively weak health infrastructure. From a market perspective, risk-reward appears attractive for India, but only if we presume the negative impact of COVID-19 is short-lived and not crippling,” Gautam Chhaochharia, Analyst, UBS Securities India Pvt. Ltd said in a report.

“Our revised Nifty target is 10,000 for end-March 2021, with upside and downside scenarios of 11,500 and 6,000, respectively,” he said.

UBS’s global macro team forecasts global GDP growth to tumble to -0.5 percent on a YoY basis, and are looking for 20-25 percent QoQ annualised declines in Q2 for a large number of economies.

Our India economist expects India's GDP growth of 4 percent for FY21. In an intermediate pandemic scenario (disruptions last until June), GDP growth could be 2.5 percent, while in a more severe pandemic scenario it could be negative, at -0.2 percent on a YoY basis.

In terms of earnings, UBS is of the view that a broad-based earnings cycle recovery over the next one to three years is clearly pushed out, with a more material near-term downside.

“In our Four Keys framework, policy retains near-term upside potential, but there could be a sharper downtick in the credit cycle before an uptick. Our new top-down earnings growth forecasts for the Nifty are 8% for FY20, 2% for FY21, and 21% for FY22,” said the report.

Given stimulus measures taken by the governments’ globally, markets have been waiting for policy stimulus, in vain until now. During the global financial crisis (GFC), India’s fiscal deficit expanded by 4.4 percent of GDP and news flow suggests 0.7 percent of GDP may be likely in this crisis.

Dividend stocks usually do not get into a free fall, and outperform most of the time. Most of these stocks have now corrected in double digits and investors can look at select stocks for the long term, suggest experts.

Top high dividend-yielding stocks according to an HDFC Securities report are Vedanta, Oil India, Balmer Lawrie, REC, ONGC, DB Corp, HEG, SJVN, IOC, PTC India, and NLC India. These stocks have a dividend yield of more than 10 percent.

What is the dividend yield?

Dividend yield (%) is the dividend per share paid by a company (on annual basis) divided by the price of that particular company/stock.

“We believe investing some of the corpus in high dividend-yield paying companies with strong fundamentals can cushion investors’ portfolios in case of an event of a fall but only to an extent,” Ajit Mishra, VP Research, Religare Broking told Moneycontrol.

“Most of these high dividend-paying companies have healthy cash reserves which could be utilized for paying dividends in difficult times as well when the core businesses get impacted,” he said.

Mishra further added that many of these stocks like Oil India and REC have decent fundamentals and therefore can be considered for long-term, assuming that these companies will continue with the current dividend rate.

India market plunged by about 30 percent since January 30 when benchmark indices hit a fresh record high amid the outbreak of COVID-19. The volatility as measured by India VIX has surpassed levels seen during the 2008 global financial crisis.

As many as 24 constituent companies in the Nifty have announced interim dividends so far in the year, according to a media report, as compared to 15 in the year-ago period.

Markets are in grip of risk aversion due to the spread of coronavirus pandemic. Post the Rs 1.7 lakh cr stimulus unveiled by the finance minister, expectations ate running high from the Reserve Bank of India to slash interest rates by 25-50 bps.

“High dividend yield stocks are worth investing in wake of falling interest rate scenario, but it must be remembered that only those high dividend-yielding stocks which have given the capital appreciation in recent past should be looked into,” Pankaj Bobade, Fundamental Research head, Axis Securities Limited told Moneycontrol.

“There have been instances of loss of invested capital, hence the investor must ensure that he should not end up into value trap in pursuit of high dividend,” he said. Bobade further added that investors should check the source of cash used for a dividend to ensure that the business generates sufficient cash for dividend distribution.

What should investors do now?

Investment in high dividend yield stocks is often seen as a way of safeguarding your investments in case of low capital appreciation as it provides consistent income. However, in case of an economic downturn only select few are better bets.

“Investors should analyze the components of dividend yield relatively i.e. the movement in the yield is not caused due to change in one single component,” Gaurav Garg, Head of Research at CapitalVia Global Research Limited- Investment Advisor told Moneycontrol.

“In normal circumstances, high dividend-yielding stocks are a great choice however during the price drop or economic recession companies may reduce the dividend or stop it altogether. Therefore it is quite unlikely that it will provide significant cushion to investor’s portfolio,” he said.

Mishra of Religare Broking said that in a volatile market scenario, where most of these stocks are trading at a 52-week low, the dividend yield of the stocks has increased and is currently higher than the prevailing interest rate.

edited excerpts:

A) The market has bounced back from the lows of 7,511 as stimulus packages were announced in the US and other developed markets.

Also rebalancing in ETFs and pension fund buying support helped the markets rally. The RBI announced an out-of-turn rate cut and measures to improve liquidity in the system.

All these factors helped the market bounce back. With these announcements through the market, sustainability will depend on the behavior of the COVID-19 curve and the new cases.

If the new cases get contained and the curve flattens then the markets will sustain otherwise the markets will correct.

A) April will be a very tricky month. A lot will depend on the lockdown period. If the lockdown period gets over by mid-April then it is very likely the markets will close the April series in positive.

If the lockdown period gets extended to end April or beyond then the markets are very likely to correct. Also, if the lockdown period gets extended then it is very likely that the bottom of 7,511 would be breached.

Q) What are your thoughts on the package announced by the government and RBI? Do you think these are enough to cushion the economic impact of COVID-19 on investors and citizens?

A) The government package of Rs 1.7 lakh crores is not very significant for the markets as it is primarily intended for the needy. The RBI will help the markets as they were expected and announcements have come at the right time.

Bond markets were seeing significant volatility. This will reduce with the injunction of liquidity measures. Overall the measures will provide some cushion to the market and help people to conduct their routines.

A) It is quite tricky to judge whether Nifty will cross the 10,000 mark. At present, it seems difficult as COVID-19 cases have continued to rise.

The number of cases in India will cross 1,000 this week and the next week will be very crucial. The level of community transmission and mortality rate will be quite critical parameters.

Edited excerpt:

Q) Last week was very volatile for the markets, but we managed to bounce back from 7,511. What is your take on the market action?

A) Indian equity markets started the week on a negative note. It started to recover from its recent low. Last week, the US approved$2 trillion stimulus package to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic which helped the market cut some losses.

The Indian market also recovered from its 4-year low after the Indian government announced a $22.5 billion relief package coupled with the rate cut.

This is the wildest time for the market in all kinds of market categories. On 27th March 2020, indices ended almost flat, however banking stocks gained after RBI Governor announced a massive 75 basis points cut in repo rates and 90 basis points cut in reverse repo rate to increase liquidity in the system.

Currently, we are nowhere close to overcoming the COVID-19 crisis. If we see a peak in cases in India and globally for another two to three weeks, (as we saw on Thursday in India when the highest number of people died in a day) then we could see the Nifty dropping back and might possibly even break its recent low. Otherwise, it might rally back to 9,700.

A) The rally which started after 2008 crises to the peak point, the Nifty has retraced nearly 50 percent of the gains from the recent all-time high of 12,430 which was made in January 2020.

The index has declined as much as 32.95 percent in the month of March so far. In April, we can say that Nifty might rally if Corona cases (domestically as well as globally) are in control.

If not, then we could see the Nifty dragging back. Stocks that investors should watch out for are Kotak Mahindra Bank Limited and Reliance Industries Limited.

A) On the last trading session of the week, indices ended almost flat after the RBI Governor announced a 75 & 90 basis points cut in the repo and reverse repo rate respectively to increase liquidity in the system and central government announced a relief package of Rs 1.7 lakh crore to respond to the Corona pandemic.

About 80 crore people will get benefit from the relief package. So, steps taken by the RBI and Indian government are in the right direction.

Apart from this for the fiscal year 2020-21, the government will also increase its borrowing plan. The government is planning to increase gross borrowing to Rs. 7.8 trillion.

A) Recently, the volatility index which is a measure of the market’s expectation of volatility over the near term is at the highest level since 2008.

Indian indices were given choppy movement on Friday after RBI Governor announced a massive 75 basis points cut in repo rates and 90 basis points cut in reverse repo rate to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Nifty50 might rally back to 9,700 if corona cases are in control else then we could see the Nifty dragging back and possibly even break its recent low of 7511.

In case 7,800 is breached on a closing basis, then one should be prepared for breach of the recent bottom of 7,511.

Experts and brokerages are of the view that the banking sector should be in the focus of policymakers as the sector is suffering the most and will have a contagion effect on all sectors of the economy.

The government and the RBI understand this and have made a slew of announcements to mitigate the pain of this sector.

The RBI governor on March 27 said the central bank was closely monitoring the situation and will step in whenever required.

“Let me assure you that the RBI is at work in mission mode. We have been monitoring the evolving financial market and the macroeconomic conditions and calibrating its operations to meet any need for additional liquidity support as well as to take other measures if warranted,” said the RBI governor.

The impact

Brokerages highlight that the lockdown of the domestic and global economies due to the COVID-19 threat will have a meaningful impact on banks’ loan-book growth.

""We have factored a lockdown of 30-45 days in our revised estimates and cut individual banks’ loan growth in FY21 by 3-5 percent and taken deterioration in asset quality. Our earnings revisions are down between 10 percent and 35 percent,"" said brokerage firm Phillip Capital.

The uncertain outlook and the country-wide lockdown has made banks vulnerable to a new leg of asset-quality crisis, with the most uncertain part being the lockdown period and the time that the economy would take to return to normalcy.

""We believe the impact on asset quality would be the least for HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, and DCB Bank, but it would be relatively high for IndusInd Bank,"" Phillip Capital said.

Domestic brokerage ICICI Securities, too, believes that the loan-book growth will take a hit.

""With the lack of any major private sector capex in the current fiscal, system credit growth was largely driven by the retail segment, which contributed nearly 91 percent of incremental credit during the year up to January 2020. We believe COVID-19 may further delay private capex revival and also decelerate the retail loan growth trajectory,"" said ICICI Securities.

""A few banks have already signalled tightening of their retail credit norms. They have also witnessed a decline in credit card spends, which will certainly impact retail loan growth.""

Not only the loan-growth, but the current lockdown will also affect cash flows of borrowers, both individual and corporate which may lead to an increase in corporate as well as retail NPAs.

A decline in loan growth and a rise in credit cost will hit the earnings of the banks.

As per the analysis of ICICI Securities, 5 percent decline in loan growth and 50 bps increase in credit cost may adversely impact banks’ earnings by an average of about 22 percent, while 5 percent decline in loan growth and 25 bps increase in credit cost may hit their earnings by an average of 13 percent.

Stocks to watch out for

Banks with stronger business models have a higher ability to sail through this rough tide.

JP Morgan believes HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and ICICI Bank offer safety with a strong funding base and minimal asset quality risk.

""While forward earnings at this time have low visibility, one can only go by a track record of companies over past down cycles and those that have managed such headwinds (2008 global financial crisis, 2013 taper tantrum, 2016 demonetization and 2018 liquidity problems) should stand out relatively better,"" JP Morgan said.

Phillip Capital has made an assessment of their relative business strength and to gauge which business model has the ability to bounce back faster.

Phillip Capital has upgraded Kotak Mahindra Bank and DCB Bank to a 'buy' with a target price of Rs 1,500 and Rs 107, respectively.

The brokerage has maintained buy recommendations on HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank with revised target prices of Rs 1,110 (Rs 1,420 earlier) and Rs 450 (Rs 660 earlier), respectively.

ICICI Securities prefers HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank, who have a proven history to contain NPAs through credit cycles with high-quality underwriting.

""We like HDFC Bank as nearly 80 percent of wholesale lending is to AA and above, nearly 75 percent of SME portfolio is secured and about 75-80 percent of unsecured loans are to salaried customers,"" ICICI Securities said.

""We will closely monitor BBB portfolio of Axis Bank (13 percent of corporate loans) and corporate & vehicle portfolio of IndusInd Bank from where incremental stress could emerge,"" it added.

24,"March 31, 2020 07:03 AM IST",1,Nishant Kumar,Hot Stocks | Here are 3 short-term buys that can give up to 10% return,"The positional trend of Nifty is still bearish as 50-days exponential moving average has been sustaining below 200-days exponential moving average.
The gap between 50-days exponential moving average and 200-days exponential moving average is substantial this time, which indicates the weakness in the overall trend.
Stocks below 200-days moving average has reached 89 percent, which was at 98 percent and 94 percent in 2008 and 2001, respectively.
Torrent Pharmaceuticals | Buy | LTP: Rs 1,948.05 | Target: Rs 2,150 | Stop loss: Rs 1,812 | Upside: 10%Torrent Pharma is one of the few stocks which are trading above its 200-day moving average.
Currently, a very low number of stocks from the NSE500 segment is trading above its 20-day moving average and this stock falls under that category.","As far as support is concerned, the level of 8,095 on Nifty would play a key role","Vinay Rajani

Last week, we saw Nifty rising more than 20 percent from the bottom of 7,511 towards 9,038. However, in the last two trading sessions, Nifty retraced more than 50 percent of that entire up move.

The positional trend of Nifty is still bearish as 50-days exponential moving average has been sustaining below 200-days exponential moving average.

In the past, we saw the development of death cross on Nifty charts in September 2019, November 2018 and December 2016 but the gap between these two averages did not enlarge to the extent which we are observing in the current scenario.

The gap between 50-days exponential moving average and 200-days exponential moving average is substantial this time, which indicates the weakness in the overall trend.

Short-term swings have widened in Nifty and 500 points move in a session has become normal nowadays.

On March 23, Nifty completed a fall of 40 percent in the span of 46 sessions, which is the second-fastest 40 percent fall after the bearish markets of the year 1992.

Stocks below 200-days moving average has reached 89 percent, which was at 98 percent and 94 percent in 2008 and 2001, respectively.

As far as support is concerned, the level of 8,095 would play a key role. The level of 8,095 happens to be the 61.8 percent retracement of the entire 20 percent pullback that Nifty registered from 7,511 to 9,038.

Retracement of more than 61.8 percent usually negates the chances of a resumption of the trend. So, any close below 8,095 would be considered bearish and Nifty could resume its primary downtrend.

If Nifty manages to hold above 8,095 then there would be two positive technical developments on the charts.

The first would be the higher bottom and the second would be the formation of inverse head and shoulder on daily line charts.

However, bullish confirmation would only come if Nifty closes above 8,660. Any close above 8,660 without violating 8,095 support could push Nifty towards 9,970, which would be derived from inverse head and shoulder pattern.

Here are three stock recommendations for the next 3-4 weeks:

Nippon India ETF Gold Bees | Buy | LTP: Rs 40 | Target: Rs 44 | Stop loss: Rs 38 | Upside: 10%

Year to date, Nifty has fallen by about 32 percent, while Gold Bees ETF has risen 16 percent.

Gold as an asset class has come out as a real outperformer in the turbulent times of global financial markets.

Gold as a commodity has resumed its uptrend after witnessing a correction. Depreciating rupee against the dollar has also been helping the Indian gold prices to outperform international gold.

Gold bees ETF has formed nice rounding bottom on the daily charts and closed at an all-time high level.

We believe that portfolios should have a higher allocation in gold at least for the next 3-6 months.

Torrent Pharmaceuticals | Buy | LTP: Rs 1,948.05 | Target: Rs 2,150 | Stop loss: Rs 1,812 | Upside: 10%

Torrent Pharma is one of the few stocks which are trading above its 200-day moving average.

Pharma as a sector is expected to outperform in the current scenario. Depreciating rupee against the dollar could also help this sector to remain strong in the coming weeks.

The stock is maintaining higher tops and higher bottoms on the monthly charts and the recent correction from the all-time high level seems to be the opportunity to create fresh long positions in the counter.

The stock tested its 200-day moving average and bounced recently. RSI has exited the oversold zone on the daily charts.

Colgate Palmolive (India) | Buy | LTP: Rs 1,220 | Target: Rs 1,345 | Stop loss: Rs 1,140 | Upside: 10%

The stock price has closed above its 5, 10 and 20-day moving average. Indicators and oscillators have turned bullish on the short-term charts.

FMCG sector is likely to do well in the current scenario. Consumer staple stocks can continue to do well in the next 1-2 months.

Currently, a very low number of stocks from the NSE500 segment is trading above its 20-day moving average and this stock falls under that category.

Fear of the global impact of the coronavirus has sent markets on a downward spiral over the past few weeks.
Given the unpredictability of the economic impact of the coronavirus on companies, institutional investors are looking to move away from equities into safer assets such as US treasuries.

It is being said that during this 21-Day lockdown in India, there are two key topics of discussion among people: a) the COVID-19 and the other is, b) markets.

This does seem well justified given the large-scale damage the Coronavirus is causing to people’s health as well as in markets.

Fear of the global impact of the coronavirus has sent markets on a downward spiral over the past few weeks. Though the government stimulus announcements helped stage a mini-recovery over the last few days, the Sensex is still down 27.2 percent over the last three months while the S&P 500 is down 18.8 percent.

The S&P 500 hit the lower circuit breaker for the first time since 1997 on March 9th and since then it hit the circuit breaker 2 more times in six trading days.

Given the unpredictability of the economic impact of the coronavirus on companies, institutional investors are looking to move away from equities into safer assets such as US treasuries.

This can be seen in the short-term treasury yields as they turned negative for the first time in more than four years on March 25th.

Given that US government bonds or Treasury bills are the safest assets in the world, they are in high demand during times of volatility.

Retail investors in buy mode:

However, an interesting trend that has emerged during this downturn is that while institutional investors have been rushing towards safer havens, retail investors have actually been calmly buying stocks during this sell-off.

According to data from Fidelity and Vanguard, two of the biggest brokers in the US, their individual clients have shown no signs of panic.

For example, approximately 1 percent of the US Vanguard households traded each day over the last two weeks versus 0.4 percent trading on each typical day.

On March 9th, Fidelity saw a buy-to-sell ratio of 2.11 to 1 even though the market dropped by 7 percent. Even more, interestingly, Indian retail investors have also been increasing their exposure to the US markets over the last few weeks.

For example, at Vested we have seen a 4x increase in funds deposited on our platform during this quarter compared to the last quarter. In the last week alone, we saw a 65 percent increase in weekly accounts opened.

While this increase could be related to investors looking to invest abroad before their annual LRS limit expires on March 31st, a large portion of investors mentioned that their reason to start now is that the crash gave them a good opportunity to start investing in the US market.

What are these investors buying?

Based on data from Fidelity and Vested, it seems like investors have been lapping up popular brands such as Apple, Amazon, Tesla, and Microsoft as these mega-caps have tumbled off of record highs.

Along with these stocks, the index ETFs such as Invesco’s Nasdaq 100 ETF QQQ or iShares’ S&P 500 ETF IVV has also seen strong interest.

While it is indeed encouraging to see increased retail investor participation during such times, a word of caution – timing the market and hoping to get it right is next to impossible.

It would be prudent to create a well-diversified portfolio and continue to hold it for a long period of time to be able to grow one’s wealth over the long-term.

Case in point is we do acknowledge the gravity of the situation but these are not the times to blame nature or anything else for the financial meltdown but to see what best can be made out of it. We have a history that shows that the best of the ideas and financial institutions came up during the Great depression of 1929! So, during these periods we need to take charge of our trading or investment decisions and see what is working in the current bear market. Now look at the below charts, Do you see any similarity in the fall? Weekly chart:

Let me reveal the secret! The first chart is of Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) from the year 1987 crash and the second chart is of Nifty Index year 2020 so far, Astonished Yet!

This is the power of looking at patterns across the market and time frames. This clearly shows that the pattern and the intensity of fall seen on Nifty is nothing but a repetition of 1987.

Also, it shows that it is Greed, Fear and Hope that results in movement of the stock market and the events only result in short-term volatility or acts as a trigger.

Coronavirus is widely referred to as the only reason for the financial and economic collapse. But, the markets were already exhibiting series of negative divergences and loss of momentum.

The major global epidemic outbreak has been during the extended period of a bear market as pointed out by Robert Prechter, Executive Director, Socionomic Institute.

The stock market acts as a barometer of social mood and the depressed stock market represents a negative social mood. It is during this period that the society is more susceptible to the epidemic outbreaks.

India has just started to catch the Corona fever and the markets have topped out much earlier in January 2020. In fact, the day honorable Prime Minister – Modi announced the 21-day lockdown on 24th March evening, the very next day on 25th March Nifty closed up 497 points – 6.37 percent higher locked biggest gain in 11 years!

Followed by another 4.10 percent gain on 26th March 2020. This has resulted in an up move of more than 1100 points on the index from the lows of 7511 made on 24 March 2020 starting the day complete India lockdown was announced.

The above indicates that freely traded markets move ahead of events or news and any trading decision based on news outflow is like driving a car looking at the rearview mirror.

Events can result in a short-term random movement which can last for a few minutes or hours or days but the original trend eventually resumes!",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/the-untold-story-2020s-nifty-crash-comparable-to-1987-not-2008-5078541.html

The broader markets relatively underperformed as the Nifty mid-cap and small-cap lost 7 percent and 8 percent, respectively.",In the coming truncated week we expect the index to consolidate in the broad range of 9000-7800 amid stock-specific action with elevated global volatility,"What a week for Indian markets! Bulls tried to make comeback but failed. And although they helped pare some losses towards the closing of the week in the benchmark indices, we cannot say the same for the broader markets.

The S&P BSE Sensex fell 0.3 percent while the Nifty50 was down by 0.97 percent for the week ended March 27, but the big carnage was seen in the broader market space where the S&P BSE Small-cap index was down 6.09 percent, and the S&P BSE Mid-cap index plunged 5.4 percent in the same period.

More than 160 stocks in the S&P BSE 500 index fell 10-30 percent, including names such as Future Consumer, Lemon Tree, Credit Access, KRBL, Future Retail, Welspun India, Bajaj Finserv, and NCC among others.

It was an eventful week for Indian markets with a flurry of stimulus packages from central bankers across the world. The United States government also gave a nod to the $2 trillion packages which was signed by the US President Donald Trump on March 27 and back home, a flurry of stimulus measure were announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das.

The government is trying to address the problem of slowdown which looks imminent. The commentary from the RBI was positive as it assured investors that the central bank is ready to take any measures whenever the situation arises.

The bounce back is encouraging but experts advise not to mistake it with a ‘reversal’. As long as the Nifty50 holds 7,511 which was the swing low March 24, things are likely to stay on the upside, however, a breach of the same could lead to further profit-taking.

""After the US’ $2 trillion stimulus, a whopping 9.5 percent of its GDP, Germany granted 21.1 percent of its GDP as a stimulus, and China granted 2.8 percent, India’s stimulus quantum looks small, but nonetheless is arriving in piecemeal packets regularly,” Jimeet Modi, Founder & CEO, SAMCO Securities & StockNote said in a note.

""While these are temporary steroids for the economy, nobody can estimate the intensity of the pain that this pandemic and lockdown is going to befall upon our economy and businesses,"" he said.

Modi further added that earnings contraction in the next two quarters is certainly a given with tourism, airlines, hotels, metals, retail outlets not under essential goods getting impacted the most, and investors must not mistake this bounce as a sharp rally, but a normal correction which will face selling pressure at higher levels.

Technical Outlook:

Equity benchmarks continue to trade with high volatility as Nifty during the previous week oscillated in a 1,500 points range and closed marginally lower by 1 percent at 8,660 to extend the decline for a six consecutive week.

The broader markets relatively underperformed as the Nifty mid-cap and small-cap lost 7 percent and 8 percent, respectively. The weekly candle suggests that the selling pressure might just be abating, and the index could consolidate in the coming week.

""The weekly price action resembles thrusting line bull candle indicating abating downward momentum, as Nifty posed a strong pullback after holding 7,500 mark twice during the week, as prices approached deep oversold trajectory after 40 percent decline from all-time high (12,430),"" Dharmesh Shah, Head – Technical, ICICI direct told Moneycontrol.

""Going ahead in the coming truncated week we expect the index to consolidate in the broad range of 9,000-7,800 amid stock-specific action with elevated global volatility aiding the index to bring some stability in the market,"" he said.

Shah further added that a retracement towards 8,000-7,800 (80 percent retracement of last week’s gain) should be utilised as an incremental buying opportunity.

Motilal Oswal suggests 10 stocks available at attractive valuations,"With the first ever two consecutive quarters of GDP decline, the Indian economy could see its first technical recession since 1990s,"" Motilal Oswal said in a strategy note.
Long term investors with good quality stocks should hold on to their portfolios and see through the current storm.
As the volatility is the friend of long term investors by making good stocks cheaper and attractive, the best strategy for retail investors would be to accumulate good fundamental and quality stocks gradually over the next few weeks and months, the brokerage suggests.
""While it is very difficult to predict the bottom of the market, it always rewards investors in the long term who take the benefit of such sharp fall,"" Motilal Oswal said.
As most of index heavyweights and quality stocks turned attractive in valuations, Motilal Oswal picks top 10 ideas which are Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank, Hindustan Unilever, HDFC, Infosys, Bharti Airtel, ICICI Bank, UltraTech Cement, Alkem Labs and Tata Consumer.","Motilal Oswal feels markets may continue to fall in near term, and that's the time to start becoming greedy. Hence the brokerage suggests accumulating on a gradual basis.","The rising fatalities and infected cases worldwide due to COVID-19 has dented market sentiment for nearly one-and-half-month now.

The benchmark indices have crashed more than 38 percent (from their record high seen in January) till March 23, but there was some short-covering and value buying in last four trading sessions due to government measures for poor and daily wage earners, and liquidity stimulus by RBI.

Now the market loss stands at over 30 percent from record highs. Globally, markets fell in the range of 20-30 percent as several industries shut their offices and plants.

With the number of cases surpassing 6.5 lakh and death toll crossing 30,000 mark worldwide, almost all the countries have announced lockdown to control the pandemic. Global activity has come to a halt, disrupting the economy and earnings in a major way.

For the time being, with the 875 active cases and 25 deaths, India's situation is relatively better than others as the government quickly implemented 21-day lockdown (except essential services) effective from March 25. It will definitely have major adverse effects on earnings and economy, but the government along with regulators have been trying hard to minimise the impact.

""A sensitivity analysis of the adverse impact of lockdown on economic activity suggests that real GDP could decline around 3 percent YoY in Q4FY20 while it could decline 12.2 percent YoY in Q1FY21, assuming that things normalise from mid-May 2020. With the first ever two consecutive quarters of GDP decline, the Indian economy could see its first technical recession since 1990s,"" Motilal Oswal said in a strategy note.

The brokerage feels if the economy, however, remains affected for a longer period, the 'self-employed' people (around 52 percent of all employment), and the 'regular wage/salaried workers' (around 23 percent) would also be seriously affected.

Complete lockdown in an already sluggish economic growth environment of India is leading to extremely volatile market conditions, Motilal Oswal said, adding if not contained well, the spread of the virus can have a significant impact on the domestic consumption-driven economy.

According to the brokerage, what makes this slowdown unique is that the policymakers' intervention – monetary or fiscally – will be broadly ineffective in addressing the economic effects unless the COVID-19 subside.

The volatility also increased sharply in last couple of weeks, as VIX hit 86 levels before falling to 70 last Friday. In such conditions, all experts advised traders to be calm and not to panic as high volatility is likely to bring more pressure on bulls, but for long term investors, it is right time to invest in quality stocks.

""Once the virus is contained, markets would stabilise. Long term investors with good quality stocks should hold on to their portfolios and see through the current storm. Traders should refrain taking long positions as all the global markets are in strong bear grip and all the small bounces have been used as selling opportunity,"" Motilal Oswal said.

As the volatility is the friend of long term investors by making good stocks cheaper and attractive, the best strategy for retail investors would be to accumulate good fundamental and quality stocks gradually over the next few weeks and months, the brokerage suggests.

Ace investors always say when the market is falling, it is difficult to predict the bottom, whereas when the market is rising and rising, the top would be difficult to predict. They further say when the market falls sharply, better be greedy and accumulate quality stocks, but when the market starts rising fast with a risk-on rally, the one should be fearful of the rally and better be out of market.

""While it is very difficult to predict the bottom of the market, it always rewards investors in the long term who take the benefit of such sharp fall,"" Motilal Oswal said.

He feels markets may continue to fall in the near term, and that's the time to start becoming greedy. Hence the brokerage suggests accumulating on a gradual basis.

With the introduction of the stimulus package from the US Fed, where they said they would buy corporate bond ETF, the move is likely to calm nerves of global investors, Kumar said.
He added that the fall is good for long-term investors because India should be able to get back on its feet in a quick time, and the time is right to accumulate jewels of India.

The bottoming out process for Indian markets has already begun. “We turned positive on Indian markets on Tuesday and the primary reason is that FPI selling is likely to reduce now, which was the primary reason for the fall in the first place,” he said.

Most of the money which was flowing out was the ETF selling and India has a 10 percent weightage in the emerging market basket. With the introduction of the stimulus package from the US Fed, where they said they would buy corporate bond ETF, the move is likely to calm nerves of global investors, Kumar said.

Indian equities, having 10 percent weight in emerging market ETFs, suffered the collateral damage. This high selloff in such a short time span cannot get matching domestic buyers.

This sharp fall in all the liquid investment asset classes happened as most of the corporations and investors moved towards cash (‘move to cash’ trades) to tide over the near term pain of a standstill economy.

He added that the fall is good for long-term investors because India should be able to get back on its feet in a quick time, and the time is right to accumulate jewels of India.

“History suggests that humanity has always won, and this too shall pass. No doubt the economy is in a difficult zone and we might be staring at a negative GDP growth in the next quarter. But, the long-term story remains intact and this is the time to buy the jewels of India,” Kumar added.

Investors should look at buying the companies where there is a strong business model, and management credibility is very strong.

COVID-19 is a threat to humanity and damage to the underlying economy is significant. Being the barometer, the equity market has fallen in tandem with this Black Swan event.

But the valuation compression is significant and the market has extrapolated current economic pains even for long-term earning potentials of the companies.

On a simplified basis, any price below the Nifty levels of 9,500 is an undervaluation level, though when the market is not in a normal rational state, it can show us any price but those surely would not be a long term reality.

After logging gains for three consecutive sessions, the Indian market witnessed profit-booking on March 27 and Nifty gave away all the gains after facing stiff resistance at 9,000-mark.

Nifty is making higher top higher bottom on intraday charts. As long as the index holds above 8,000, we can expect the positive momentum to continue towards 9,350 than 9,500.

However, the broader structure still looks weak and one should refrain from creating any aggressive long positions.

We have already seen a strong pullback from lower levels, so risk and reward are not in favour of the longs. Although, we are expecting pullback which is unlikely to sustain at higher levels and we may see another leg on the downside once this pullback gets over.

The immediate support is now placed at 8,300 and below that, the index may again slip towards 8,000 levels.

The volatility index India VIX fell for the third consecutive session and it ended near 71 levels; now it has to fall below 50 levels to give comfort to the bulls.

Bank Nifty underperformed Nifty in the previous week and remained under pressure. The immediate resistance is placed at 22,500 levels. Immediate support is pegged at 18,600 and below that, it may drift to 17,500 levels.

Here are three stock recommendations for the next 3-4 weeks:

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) | Buy | LTP: 1,850 | Target price: Rs 1,900-1,950 | Stop loss: Rs 1,770 | Upside: 5%

The stock has provided a breakout from its symmetrical triangle pattern on the intraday chart.

The MACD has also provided fresh buy crossover on the daily chart. Now, it seems like the stock may attempt to fill the gap which is placed at Rs 1,900 levels in the short-term.

Coal India | Buy | LTP: 131.15 | Target price: Rs 139 | Stop loss: Rs 125 | Upside: 6%

The stock seems to be forming a base and is on the verge of a breakout from its rectangle pattern on the intraday chart which is placed at Rs 134 levels.

Above that, a sharp move could be seen towards Rs 144 levels.

The momentum indicator RSI has also reversed from the oversold territory which indicates positive momentum in the stock.

TVS Motor Company | Sell | LTP: Rs 304 | Target price: Rs 285 | Stop loss: Rs 316 | Downside: 6%

The stock has provided breakdown from a rounding top pattern and also making lower high and lower low formation on the weekly scale.

The momentum oscillator MACD is very well in sell mode on the weekly chart.​

edited excerpts:

Q) It was a volatile week for Indian markets, but the good part is we managed to bounce back from 7,511 thanks to the various fiscal measures taken by the government and authorities around the world. What is your take on the market action?

A) In October 2008 when the US Fed had announced a stimulus package, markets rebounded for some time, but thereafter the slide continued. Price destruction was lesser post the stimulus package.

Time-wise it took another 5 months for the market to really begin the bull run. The current actions across the world including lockdowns, stimulus packages, fiscal & monetary incentives will help markets stabilise, but it will take time for markets to enter a new bull orbit. Substantial price correction may not happen, but time correction may happen.

Q) After registering a series on series fall of more than 25 percent in March, what is the sense you are getting for the April series. Do you think we could hopefully close in the positive – what does the data suggest and any stocks which investors should watch/avoid? Have we made a bottom around 7511?

A) April series will be positive given that markets will try and bounce back from oversold levels. As such the lockdown effect will be felt in months to come.

April will most likely be a ""wait and watch"" period. It can close in positive since the markets are deep in the oversold zone, but for the time being, 7,511 can be taken as a bottom in the intermediate-term.

A) The package announced by the government addressed the bottom of the pyramid i.e. 20 percent economic interest; however, 80 percent of the economic interest has not been touched upon.

It is here where the slowdown will have an impact, least to say RBI has only allowed postponement of interest/ loan repayment by 3 months, nonetheless, they will have to be paid.

Therefore, as such government in the name of welfare policies has helped the weaker economic population, but MSMEs, entrepreneurs, businessmen - large & small, organized workforce are left on their own.

A) April may turn out to be a sucker’s rally where the fence-sitters will be pulled in. We will see some amount of price stabilizing but a major rally to go past 10,000 on the Nifty is less likely.

A) As such announcements will not have a direct impact on companies, but the Financials sector will get respite.

The RBI has in a way relaxed conditions for NPAs, therefore financials space will stabilize going forward. We would wait for some more time to assess the actual impact of Coronavirus on businesses before suggesting particular stocks for long term investment.

COVID-19 outbreak across the world has disrupted economic activity across the world. The relief package is just one of the measures which the government has deployed to cushion the economic impact, but it may not be enough, fear experts.

Apart from the package which was announced on Thursday, there is a desperate need to support industries like manufacturing, tourism, aviation as well as automobiles. The total cost of the stimulus, including the one which was announced on Thursday, could well be in the range of 1-2 percent of GDP, suggest experts.

The Rs 1.7 lakh cr relief package announced under the ‘Gareeb Kalyan Scheme’ is targeted at the most vulnerable sections of the society to support them with food as well as direct cash transfers as the economy takes a halt in the 21-Days lockdown for a period of 3-months.

“Comprehensive package for the poor and vulnerable. The focus is ""nobody should go hungry.” No announcements for stimulating the economy. Perhaps later. This is a package for lockdown impacted segments,” Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services told Moneycontrol.

“Regarding relief to MSMEs etc the FM said ""we will look into it. "" So industry-specific measures likely to be announced in the next package. The govt is prioritising. This can go a long way in implementing the lockdown,” he said.

Experts feel that the next round of packages could be for the industry and especially for the sectors such as banks, consumption, hospitality, auto, durables, agriculture, and healthcare.

“A package from the government has to address three broad areas (1) protecting livelihoods, (2) protecting businesses, and (3) strengthening the healthcare infrastructure for COVID-19. To this end, the government needs to provide for viability of businesses and employees which will be at the highest risk from social distancing and lockdown such as hotel, restaurants, transport, entertainment, etc.,” Suvodeep Rakshit, Vice President & Sr. Economist, Kotak Institutional Equities told Moneycontrol.

“The support to these segments could be in the form of cheap credit lines, regulatory/financial forbearance, tax benefits, direct cash transfers, and income supports,” he said.

Rakshit further added that while the cost will depend on the extent and depth of the program as well as the expected time period of a hard lockdown, we pencil in around 2.0-2.5% of GDP as the probable stimulus size that the government may have to look at.

We spoke to various experts on expectations of the package which could be announced for the industry. Here’s what they have to say:

Expert: Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services

The package should have direct cash transfer to daily workers, unorganized and farm sectors. The idea should be to restrict job losses in the country, and provide relief to the highly hit sectors and encourage the health segment to handle the COVID-19 issue.

Ease measures is also expected for Banks to manage the risk of an increase in NPA. The size of the package could be about 1% of India’s GDP which could be about $30bn, Rs2trn in INR.

Expert: Asutosh Mishra, Head of Research - Institutional Equity, Ashika Stock Broking

We expect stimulus package to primarily address income loss of urban workforce by giving direct cash transfer, free gas cylinders, interest subvention on selected personal loans and higher spending on the healthcare and pharma sector.

Apart from that, we expect a comprehensive package for airlines, hospitality, tourism sectors and export segments, which are worst impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak. Given the level of disruption, we expect a package to be approx 1-1.5% of the nominal GDP.

Expert: Gaurav Garg, Head of Research at CapitalVia Global Research Limited- Investment Advisor

We need to spend money on medical supplies, ventilators, masks and getting protective equipment for medical workers quickly. People are going to lose jobs not only in rural areas but in urban areas also.

In terms of sectors, the government should provide stimulus package for the most impacted ones like Hotels & Hospitality, Tourism, Aviation, Automobile, as these are major employment contributing sectors for the Indian economy and these are some of the worst-affected sectors due to travel bans, social distancing, and suspension of business activities.

As these sectors are having huge debts as well so a loan restructuring scheme could be announced. Apart from this government may allow them for delayed bills payments. License renewal expansion could also be the kind of Stimulus package.

We can say that the April series is going to be very choppy with moves on both sides, unlike March series where the market has fallen vertically.
Some public sector utility (PSU) stocks are also looking very attractive as their current dividend yield is much higher than the risk-free rate of return.
If Nifty manages to cross 10,000 levels then we can say that the bear market has been over and it is the start of a fresh bull market.
Hindustan Unilever, ITC, Dabur, Colgate Palmolive, and Nestle are some stocks that could do well if the market sees any kind of strength.","If Nifty can come above 10,000 levels if the situations in front of COVID-19 improves from here because valuations are very attractive at current levels.","Q. A volatile week for Indian markets! But, the good part is that we bounced back from the swing low of 7,511 – thanks to measures taken by the US Fed as well as our own government to help the economy and citizens in these tough times. What is your take on the market action?

A. A roller coaster ride from the last weekend ended almost on a flat note where the week begins with a black Monday but then the market formed a near term bottom at 7,511 levels for a very strong pullback rally which paused after the exact move of 20 percent.

The major problem of the coronavirus (COVID-19) is still persisting where the current bear market rally was on the back of major stimulus announced in the United States and India, therefore, a real test of this rally will be in the next week.

The real test of the low will happen in the coming week as major announcements have already happened, and now the trend in new cases of COVID-19 will dictate the next trend of the market from here.

A. It is very tough to make a call for April series after a brutal fall in March series because there are still lots of uncertainty about COVID-19 where the market has discounted almost worst-case scenario including a lockdown of 21-days. But if the situation further deteriorates from here then the market will again adjust itself in the downside.

We can say that the April series is going to be very choppy with moves on both sides, unlike March series where the market has fallen vertically.

If we see some improvement in the curve of new cases of COVID-19 especially in the US and India then we can say that 7,511 is a bottom for the market otherwise one more move on the downside cannot be ruled out.

In terms of stocks -- healthcare and pharma stocks are looking very lucrative because they will have face any major impact of the lockdown while governments around the world will come with a higher budget for the healthcare sector in the future.

Some public sector utility (PSU) stocks are also looking very attractive as their current dividend yield is much higher than the risk-free rate of return.

A. The government came out with a relief package for the poor while it may come out with a stimulus package for the economy in the future.

If we talk about RBI’s measures then we can say that these measures will definitely help in the stability of the financial system and it will also help the financial sector to deal with any liquidity problem.

All measures will be helpful for the economy but the situation of COVID-19 should not deteriorate from here otherwise things will become tough for the overall economy.

A. As I said it is tough to make a call about April month but Nifty definitely can come above 10,000 levels if the situations in front of COVID-19 improves from here because valuations are very attractive at current levels.

If Nifty manages to cross 10,000 levels then we can say that the bear market has been over and it is the start of a fresh bull market.

A. If we talk about recent announcements then it is clear that government is caring about the poor. Hand-outs to the lowest sections of society may result in higher off-take of consumer staples, therefore, FMCG is the sector which may outperform the market as it is also comparatively less impacted by lockdown in the country.

Hindustan Unilever, ITC, Dabur, Colgate Palmolive, and Nestle are some stocks that could do well if the market sees any kind of strength.

17,"March 28, 2020 04:37 PM IST",-1,Jocelyn Fernandes,Coronavirus pandemic | I became a disciplined investor over 40 years; the virus broke me in 40 days,"That Friday, March 13, stock markets staged a late-afternoon rally as Trump promised new measures to contain the virus and shore up the economy.
The most recent bear market, which started in 2007, lasted 17 months.
I take heart from this: During that previous bear market, the S&P was never down more than 50% from its 2007 peak.
Even in the Great Depression, the worst bear market ever, the S&P dropped 86%.
Some of the biggest rallies have come in the middle of the worst bear markets.","I've owned stocks for nearly 40 years. I've lived through, survived and even prospered through four crashes. So I should be prepared. Yet, looking back at the last few weeks, I recognize that I've violated most of my time-tested rules","James B. Stewart

It’s Thursday morning, March 19 — four weeks into the coronavirus crash of 2020. The Dow Jones industrial average has opened down another 700 points, after plunging below 20,000 a day before. It’s down 30% in a month, the steepest drop ever, even worse than during the Great Depression.

The fall has been nauseating. Yet I know this is a time to be buying stocks based on rules I’ve developed over decades of investing. But in order to do that, I have to log on to my brokerage account. When I do, the first number I’ll see is the current market value of my portfolio.

Isolated at a farmhouse in rural New York, surrounded by wilderness, I haven’t looked in days. I don’t want to look now.

I decide I’d better check the weather forecast instead. And then there’s email to catch up on. An hour later, I’ve done nothing.

I’m paralyzed.

I’ve owned stocks for nearly 40 years. I’ve lived through, survived and even prospered through four crashes.

So I should be prepared. Yet, looking back at the last few weeks, I recognize that I’ve violated most of my time-tested rules. Whipsawed between optimism and despair as the bad news mounted and my daily life was upended, I’ve let emotions influence my decisions. I’m doing it again this morning.

An Unfathomable Fall

I first bought a stock mutual fund during the summer of 1982, as soon as I’d saved enough money to invest. My father, a Cadillac-driving sales manager for NBC’s local TV and radio affiliates, had been an avid believer in the stock market, and he’d drummed his faith into me.

It turned out that 1982 was a great year to buy, not that I realized it at the time. For years, I enjoyed the positive reinforcement of a steadily rising market. I loved looking up my mutual fund in the newspaper stock tables. Over the next five years the market tripled.

On Oct. 19, 1987, I was visiting my brother, who was spending a semester in France. When I left my hotel in Strasbourg early the next morning, I noticed the front pages on newsstands carried banner headlines reporting the Dow had dropped “23.” I wondered why the U.S. market was front-page news in France. I looked more closely and saw the 23 preceded a percentage symbol. The Dow had dropped an unfathomable 508 points in one day. On a percentage basis, it was the stock market’s worst day ever.

I felt a powerful urge to salvage what was left of my modest savings by selling. But I was far away and had no choice but to hold.

Once I was back in the United States, the market seemed to stabilize. But volatility soon returned. In one of those downdrafts, I panicked and sold my entire fund.

By September 1989, the market had recovered all its losses. I watched from the sidelines, waiting in vain for a good time to get back in.

I vowed to never again trade in a panic. I made a rule — never sell on a down day — and a corollary: Never buy on an up day.

That served me well over the next decade’s record bull market, fueled by the tech boom. Times were even headier than during the 1980s. I often overheard personal trainers at the gym boasting about their favorite tech stocks.

The notion of diversification was largely unknown to me. In early 2000, when the tech bubble burst and the next crash came, I was fully invested and stayed that way. I watched as the value of my investments shriveled. I stopped looking at stock tables, which at least provided some psychological comfort. I dropped my monthly paper statements into the trash unopened.

But at least I adhered to my 1987 principle: I did not sell.

In the wake of the two-year bear market, I refined my strategy. I figured that if I bought every time the market average declined by 10% from its previous high — the standard definition of a correction — and then bought some more after each subsequent decline of 10%, then I’d never be buying at the top of the cycle.

I didn’t think of this as market timing since I made no prediction where the market was headed. My strategy was a variation of the now widespread practice of portfolio rebalancing — selling some asset classes and buying others to maintain a steady allocation.

I put this system into practice during the 2008 financial crisis. I recall shocked reactions that October when — with the market plunging and others boasting that they’d had the foresight to get out — I said I was buying.

What’s Another Virus Scare?

There have been only five 10% corrections since then, and each was a buying opportunity for me. None was followed by a second 10% decline. The last of these corrections came at the end of 2018. As cash built up in my account, I wondered when, if ever, I’d get another such opportunity. I grew impatient. On Feb. 19, the S&P 500 closed at a record high. No one seemed to see a bear market or recession on the horizon, even as stock multiples teetered at record highs and a strange virus began to spread.

Until a week later.

Stocks fell, slowly at first, then gaining steam. By Feb. 25 the S&P 500 had dropped 7.6% from its peak.

So I bought stock (a broad-based index fund) on Feb. 25, jumping the gun on my own 10% buying target. My pent-up eagerness and optimism overwhelmed my disciplined strategy. I didn’t make a conscious decision to violate it. I didn’t even think about it in my haste to take advantage of what I assumed would be a fleeting opportunity.

Stocks dropped a little more the next day. Then, on Feb. 27, the S&P plunged nearly 5%. Now the market was officially in a correction, its fastest ever, down 12% from the peak the prior week. The coronavirus had spread globally, including to the United States.

I realized I should have waited. I felt foolish and guilty for violating my rules. I vowed not to do it again.

The Biggest Drop Since Black Monday

But how smart I felt the next Monday. The S&P soared nearly 5%, amid rumors the Federal Reserve was about to cut interest rates.

The high was short-lived. By the end of the week, the S&P had erased Monday’s gains. By now I was worried, too, but I’m not an infectious disease expert. I figured stocks had priced in the risks. What I did know was that they were now deep into a correction, and so I bought more.

My buying may have been premature the first time, but now I was back on track, sticking to my playbook. At a time of soaring uncertainty on so many fronts, I felt like I was taking charge of my destiny.

That was the last time that buying stocks felt good, like I was pouncing on a fleeting opportunity. It soon became a source of profound anxiety.

Over the first weekend in March, headlines were all about the explosive spread of the virus in Italy. Photos of deserted piazzas drove home the gravity of the situation. What had seemed a distant threat now seemed close to home.

If that weren’t bad enough, Russia and Saudi Arabia decided to launch an oil price war just as demand was collapsing. Oil prices plummeted, dragging down the entire energy sector.

I expected it would be a bad Monday in the markets, but it was even worse. Circuit breakers kicked in to halt chaotic trading. The S&P closed down that day by 7%, the biggest drop since Black Monday in 1987.

I summoned the nerve to look at my brokerage account. I was shocked: The stock portion was down far more than the broad U.S. market averages. My international stock index fund was down 20% from its February peak, and the emerging markets fund had lost one-quarter of its value.

On Thursday, March 12, after President Donald Trump banned most air travel between the United States and continental Europe and after economies around the world started shutting down, the carnage in the stock market was even worse than Monday. The S&P dropped 10%, leaving it 27% below its peak a few weeks earlier.

According to my own rules, it was time to buy.

I hardly noticed. I was busy canceling a planned vacation the next week to the Virgin Islands. I began pondering the prospect of my own isolation, something that even a few days earlier had seemed unthinkable.

Worse, a friend in Spain, a healthy 40-year-old I had just visited in November, had fallen seriously ill with the virus. He was in a coma in a Madrid hospital.

Still, during the following days, when I pondered the rush of events during some long walks along a country road, I recognized I was running out of excuses for inaction. I knew I should be buying again, with the S&P remaining well below my 20% target. But trading was more volatile than anything I’d ever witnessed. The S&P logged a record seven straight days of swings of 4% or more.

That Friday, March 13, stock markets staged a late-afternoon rally as Trump promised new measures to contain the virus and shore up the economy. The S&P 500 closed almost exactly 20% below its peak. Still I did nothing.

It was just as well. On Monday, the market collapsed, erasing all of Friday’s gains. The Dow fell below the 20,000 milestone for the first time in three years. Markets were now down 30%. It was time for me to buy.

Having skipped the 20% buying “opportunity,” I knew it was time to step up. But I wasn’t going to do it on a day the markets had been in free fall. And in any event, I was back to avoiding my brokerage’s website.

The next day the stock market jumped higher. I felt a strong temptation to buy, gripped by the notion that the worst might be over. I worried I was missing the bottom by again failing to act on my strategy. But the 30% window had closed, and I reminded myself that my rule is never to buy on an up day.

The next day brought what seemed like good news: New infections in China had dropped to zero. Even so, that morning markets sank, again triggering my 30% buying target. This time I was determined to act.

And yet I dawdled. I checked the news, the weather, my emails. I told myself this was absurd. Whether I looked or not, my portfolio value was what it was.

So I looked. It was bad but not nearly the shock of the last time (perhaps because percentage declines now translated to lower dollar amounts). I still had ample cash on hand as interest and dividends had accumulated over recent years.

So I stepped in and bought.

I won’t say I felt euphoric, but I felt better than I had in weeks, at least about my personal finances. I’d mustered the courage to face the truth, however grim. I’d acted according to a plan. I had more cash if needed for the next 10% decline.

My renewed confidence survived the next downdraft, which came the very next day.

The Market Soared. I Felt No Elation.

Nothing I experienced in the past prepared me for the speed of this market crash. The decline after stocks peaked in March 2000 lasted until October 2002 — 2 1/2 years. The most recent bear market, which started in 2007, lasted 17 months. Nobody knows how long this bear market will last.

I take heart from this: During that previous bear market, the S&P was never down more than 50% from its 2007 peak. Even in the Great Depression, the worst bear market ever, the S&P dropped 86%. Small comfort, perhaps, but it never went to zero. And after those steep drops, the market not only recovered but eventually went on to record highs.

This week brought some good news. My friend in Spain emerged from his coma. Doctors say his recovery will be slow, but they’re optimistic.

On Tuesday the market soared, followed by two more days of gains. This time I felt no elation. Some of the biggest rallies have come in the middle of the worst bear markets.

My next target is when the S&P falls 40% from its peak. I may be buying again soon.

The past month was brutal for the Indian equity markets. The Nifty50 collapsed over 30 percent, making it one of the worst monthly performances ever.

The markets appear to be gripped by extreme panic. The Volatility Index or India VIX (a widely followed fear gauge) exceeded the level last reached at the peak of the Global Financial Crisis in November 2008.

So the panic in the markets has reached a peak. But, is the situation today as bad as what was experienced in 2008?

A problem with assessing damage from the current crisis is that it is not an event but a fast-evolving condition. It will impact both demand as well as supply and it is hard to fathom its extent and duration- leading to fear of the unknown.

Often, when we are in the middle of a crisis; it is easy to overlook the effect of countervailing forces that are unleashed by the policymakers.

We are beginning to see a coordinated monetary and fiscal action by the central bank and the governments. While the Indian markets seem to have shrugged off these measures so far, we believe policymakers are in the mood to do whatever it takes to stabilise the situation.

With so much of negativity, it is also easy to overlook the two positives that have emerged. Firstly, oil prices have collapsed. This is a huge positive for India. It is good for the current account, fiscal balance, inflation and interest rates.

Most importantly, it gives the government much-needed headroom to do targeted spending to tide over the current situation.

Secondly, with a sharp downturn in stock prices, valuations are getting attractive, even compelling in some cases.

Overall, the Nifty for a long time was trading at a premium to long-term trading averages, and is now available at a discount, even after accounting for a potential cut in an earnings forecast.

So, what should investors do? Here is what we think:

While negative emotions are running high, we believe this is perhaps the worst time to exit/redeem equities. An exit in a panic now will likely lead to regret from a medium-term perspective.

While prices have fallen off the cliff, we would caution that it is also risky to invest all your investible surplus at one go. The crisis is far from over and we do not know where the bottom is.

The most prudent and rational course of action is to use the current prices to start investing (given a good risk-reward available) but to do so gradually over a period of time.

22,"March 28, 2020 07:44 AM IST",2,Nishant Kumar,Kotak advises accumulating these 10 large-cap stocks amid virus-led uncertainty,"Take a look:ICICI Bank | BuyAs per Kotak, the company has seen no major signs of stress in any other retail segment.
Kotak has retained its fair value of Rs 10,200 for Bajaj Finserv.
Bajaj Finance, valued at its RGM-based fair value, adds 74 percent to the SoTP.
We remain buyers; fair Value revised to Rs 300 per share,"" Kotak said.
""These two changes, plus rollover, drive an increase in fair value estimate to Rs 1,475,"" said Kotak.","The gains of the last two consecutive sessions have given bulls some support. However, experts say the market will see a sustained rise only if the cases of coronavirus show a continuous decline going forward.","COVID-19 has shaken the market worldwide. Investor sentiment is unusually low as experts fear the economic impact of the lockdown and widespread coronavirus.

Global brokerage JP Morgan expects about 60 percent of the GDP to be significantly hit by the lockdown.

Deutsche Bank thinks India's GDP growth will collapse in April-June and maybe a negative print of 5 percent year-on-year (YoY) or even more. It said there is a possibility that the July-September real GDP will also be negative.

The gains of the last two consecutive sessions have given bulls some support. However, experts say the market will see a sustained rise only if the cases of coronavirus show a continuous decline going forward.

""The rally was driven by expectations of stimulus measures to support the respective economies and not because of any change in ground realities. A much more stable rally can happen only after any news regarding the virus containment comes in,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.

During times of uncertainty, have a prudent approach in stock picking. A well-calculated move will maximise the chances of gains and minimise the risk if one has a long-term approach, say experts.

Brokerage firm Kotak Securities suggests following 10 large-cap stocks for accumulation. Take a look:

ICICI Bank | Buy

As per Kotak, the company has seen no major signs of stress in any other retail segment. Corporate slippages of Rs 2,470 crore (nearly 4.2 percent of corporate loans) were mainly from outside the ‘BB and below’ book (nearly 70 percent of corporate slippages) and were largely driven by stockbroking account (fully provided during the quarter) and a South India-based industrial account.

The estimates of Kotak shows ICICI Bank's net NPL may reduce to about 1 percent by FY22E with slippages of nearly 1.7 percent in FY21-22E. Loan growth may improve to nearly 17 percent by FY21-22E while it expects CASA CAGR of nearly 13 percent over FY19-22E and stable CASA ratio of nearly 46 percent. Calculated NIM may stand at nearly 3.6 percent over FY20-22E.

Kotak believes ICICI bank's RoE is well-positioned for nearly 15 percent or even more in medium term. They have a positive value and value the bank at Rs 615 implying 2.4 times book and 15 times December FY21 EPS.

Bajaj Finserv | Add

With increasing share of protection business (6 percent of APE in FY2019) and non-par savings (18 percent of individual APE in Q3FY20, up from 4 percent in Q2FY19), VNB margins will likely expand, said Kotak.

Kotak has retained its fair value of Rs 10,200 for Bajaj Finserv. Bajaj Finance, valued at its RGM-based fair value, adds 74 percent to the SoTP. It values the general insurance business at 4.5 times book, similar to the valuation multiple assigned to ICICI Lombard. It values Bajaj Life at 1.5 times EV, significantly lower than its peers, as it expects its operating RoEV to remain at 11-12 times.

HDFC | Buy

Kotak believes HDFC's gross stage-3 loans will remain stable around about 1.5 percent over FY21-22E (up from 1.4 percent in FY19) with 49 percent coverage, 17 percent CAGR in AUM over FY21-22E, core NIM to increase to 2.6 percent in FY22E from about 2.4 percent in FY20E.

Moreover, Kotak expects HDFC to deliver 17 percent core earnings CAGR in FY20-22E on the back of 11 percent YoY growth in FY20E. At its fair value of Rs 2,680, HDFC will trade at 2.6 times core book December 2021E (juxtaposed to medium-term RoE of 19-20 percent even as near-term RoE may be lower).

HDFC Life Insurance Company | Add

In Q3FY20, HDFC Life reported a 25 percent growth in VNB on the back of 19 percent APE growth and moderate VNB expansion to 24.7 percent from 23.4 percent in Q3FY19.

HDFC Life remains a highly profitable life insurance company with about 20-21 percent operating RoEV and 20 percent EVOP CAGR during FY2019-22E; this is supported by VNB margins of nearly 26 percent.

Colgate Palmolive (India) | Add

Kotak highlighted that selective price hikes and favorable RM environment cushioned the impact of continued aggression on promotions.

""It is encouraging to note that Colgate has continued its brand investment in Q3FY120 where several of its peers pulled back sharply. Ad spend effectiveness remains low, however,"" Kotak said.

Lower revenue growth, as well as margin assumptions, drive a 6-7 percent cut in our FY20-22E EPS forecasts. ""We keep the faith and retain 'add' even as the street may now prefer waiting for evidence,"" said Kotak.

ITC | Buy

National Calamity Contingent Duty (NCCD) hikes in the Budget, different for different stick lengths implies a portfolio level weighted-average tax/stick increase of around 10 percent, Kotak said.

""Weak 9-months FY20 numbers, NCCD hikes and ability to protect volumes in a poor macro backdrop prompt us to lower our volume assumptions and now bake in a 5 percent EBIT growth for the cigarette business in FY21E versus 9.7 percent earlier,"" said Kotak.

""Valuations are cheap, especially on a relative basis, but unlikely to act as a trigger. We remain buyers; fair Value revised to Rs 300 per share,"" Kotak said.

Titan Company | Add

Even assuming Titan’s addressable market is around 50-60 percent of the total jewellery market in India, Titan’s share of the addressable market is in the 10-12 percent range, Kotak said.

After Q3FY20 results the company had maintained its guidance of 11-13 percent revenue growth for Q4FY20.

Kotak has now lowered the cost of equity assumption in its DCF by 50 bps to 10.75 percent and also taken up terminal growth rate assumption by 50 bps to 5.75 percent. ""These two changes, plus rollover, drive an increase in fair value estimate to Rs 1,475,"" said Kotak.

Cipla | Buy

Kotak highlighted that Cipla’s Goa facility had received a warning letter but its earnings impact is limited given limited new product dependence on Goa.

The impact of the warning letter is not material to FY21 earnings, considering that single source products from the facility account for less than 10 percent of US revenues (nearly 20 percent of US in total) and limited (single digit) approvals linked to the facility over the next 12-18 months.

Cipla management has been highlighting its renewed commitment to the domestic business, which accounts for more than 50 percent of EBITDA. Kotak believes the domestic business should grow in line or slightly higher than the market over the next few years.

Moreover, Kotak sees a strong US generics build-out over FY21-23, given Q4CY20 launch for ProVentil and Q4CY20 partner launch for CiproDex.

Kotak expects the momentum to continue in FY22/23 with potential launches of generic Advair (March 2019 filing) and Abraxane.

Reliance Industries (RIL) | Buy

RIL turned FCF positive for the first time since Q3FY13, with capex declining by 27 percent QoQ to Rs 14.020 crore.

Kotak reiterates a 'buy' notwithstanding a bleak downstream outlook, as the company may benefit meaningfully from plausible consolidation in telecom, the culmination of key transactions, rising FCF trajectory and sustained growth in the retail segment.

Kotak believes higher crude discounts, weaker rupee and potential hike in ARPUs may mitigate lower downstream margins.

Bharti Airtel | Buy

""Bharti is extremely well positioned to benefit from whatever direction industry dynamics take from hereon, in our view. From an execution standpoint, there is ample evidence to suggest that the company is now operating in top gear,"" said Kotak.

""Sharp run up in the past year or so notwithstanding, Bharti remains a solid multi-year compounding play as long as the company and R-Jio resist the alpha-male tendencies in the forthcoming spectrum auctions,"" Kotak added.

The Cup & Handle pattern is believed to be one of the most reliable and popular patterns among traders community.

In technical analysis, a Cup & Handle pattern describes a specific chart formation that projects a bearish-to-bullish trend reversal. A Cup & Handle reversal pattern forms after a downtrend, and its completion marks a trend reversal to uptrend.

In the standard Cup & Handle pattern, we connect the high after Cup with the high created after the handle. A trend line is drawn by connecting these highest points of the two peaks, which is called as 'Neckline'. This trend line is the most important component of C & H pattern.

Why Buy India Cements?

C & H pattern is an integral part of technical analysis, but successful traders combine these techniques with technical indicators and other forms of technical analysis to maximise their odds of success.

India Cements has a strong resistance line standing around Rs 102 levels indicating strong bullish breakout only above these levels. The recent formation of Cup and Handle pattern will give a breakout on a close above Rs 102 mark which suggests buying in the stock for higher targets of Rs 122. Volume can also add further insight while trading these patterns. Decent volume participation while giving breakout is also giving support to C & H pattern.

Figure.1. Cup & Handle pattern and Buy signal on INDIACEM

1. A close above neckline (Rs 102) of Cup & Handle pattern is indicating a trend reversal.2. Short- term moving average 20 DMA (Rs 99.50), which defines short-term trend, is providing support to buyers as prices are sustained and trading above it.3. Mid- term moving average 50 DMA (Rs 96.15), which defines mid-term trend, augurs well with the bulls as prices are sustained and trading above it.

4. Decent volume participation while pattern breakout will also give additional confirmation.

Profit Booking

Target as per Cup & Handle pattern is calculated by adding the height of Cup to the neckline which comes to Rs 122, however one can book profits near previous swing high which is around Rs 120.

Stop Loss

Entire bullish view negates on breaching of Handle on a closing basis and one should exit from a long position. In the case of India Cements, it is placed around Rs 89 levels.

Conclusion

We recommend buying The India Cements above Rs 102 with a stop loss of Rs 89 for higher targets of Rs 122 as indicated in the above chart.
