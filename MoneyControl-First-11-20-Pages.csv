Dividend stocks usually do not get into a free fall, and outperform most of the time. Most of these stocks have now corrected in double digits and investors can look at select stocks for the long term, suggest experts.

Top high dividend-yielding stocks according to an HDFC Securities report are Vedanta, Oil India, Balmer Lawrie, REC, ONGC, DB Corp, HEG, SJVN, IOC, PTC India, and NLC India. These stocks have a dividend yield of more than 10 percent.

What is the dividend yield?

Dividend yield (%) is the dividend per share paid by a company (on annual basis) divided by the price of that particular company/stock.

“We believe investing some of the corpus in high dividend-yield paying companies with strong fundamentals can cushion investors' portfolios in case of an event of a fall but only to an extent,” Ajit Mishra, VP Research, Religare Broking told Moneycontrol.

“Most of these high dividend-paying companies have healthy cash reserves which could be utilized for paying dividends in difficult times as well when the core businesses get impacted,” he said.

Mishra further added that many of these stocks like Oil India and REC have decent fundamentals and therefore can be considered for long-term, assuming that these companies will continue with the current dividend rate.

India market plunged by about 30 percent since January 30 when benchmark indices hit a fresh record high amid the outbreak of COVID-19. The volatility as measured by India VIX has surpassed levels seen during the 2008 global financial crisis.

As many as 24 constituent companies in the Nifty have announced interim dividends so far in the year, according to a media report, as compared to 15 in the year-ago period.

Markets are in grip of risk aversion due to the spread of coronavirus pandemic. Post the Rs 1.7 lakh cr stimulus unveiled by the finance minister, expectations ate running high from the Reserve Bank of India to slash interest rates by 25-50 bps.

“High dividend yield stocks are worth investing in wake of falling interest rate scenario, but it must be remembered that only those high dividend-yielding stocks which have given the capital appreciation in recent past should be looked into,” Pankaj Bobade, Fundamental Research head, Axis Securities Limited told Moneycontrol.

“There have been instances of loss of invested capital, hence the investor must ensure that he should not end up into value trap in pursuit of high dividend,” he said. Bobade further added that investors should check the source of cash used for a dividend to ensure that the business generates sufficient cash for dividend distribution.

What should investors do now?

Investment in high dividend yield stocks is often seen as a way of safeguarding your investments in case of low capital appreciation as it provides consistent income. However, in case of an economic downturn only select few are better bets.

“Investors should analyze the components of dividend yield relatively i.e. the movement in the yield is not caused due to change in one single component,” Gaurav Garg, Head of Research at CapitalVia Global Research Limited- Investment Advisor told Moneycontrol.

“In normal circumstances, high dividend-yielding stocks are a great choice however during the price drop or economic recession companies may reduce the dividend or stop it altogether. Therefore it is quite unlikely that it will provide significant cushion to investor's portfolio,” he said.

Mishra of Religare Broking said that in a volatile market scenario, where most of these stocks are trading at a 52-week low, the dividend yield of the stocks has increased and is currently higher than the prevailing interest rate.

The Cup & Handle pattern is believed to be one of the most reliable and popular patterns among traders community.

In technical analysis, a Cup & Handle pattern describes a specific chart formation that projects a bearish-to-bullish trend reversal. A Cup & Handle reversal pattern forms after a downtrend, and its completion marks a trend reversal to uptrend.

In the standard Cup & Handle pattern, we connect the high after Cup with the high created after the handle. A trend line is drawn by connecting these highest points of the two peaks, which is called as 'Neckline'. This trend line is the most important component of C & H pattern.

Why Buy India Cements?

C & H pattern is an integral part of technical analysis, but successful traders combine these techniques with technical indicators and other forms of technical analysis to maximise their odds of success.

India Cements has a strong resistance line standing around Rs 102 levels indicating strong bullish breakout only above these levels. The recent formation of Cup and Handle pattern will give a breakout on a close above Rs 102 mark which suggests buying in the stock for higher targets of Rs 122. Volume can also add further insight while trading these patterns. Decent volume participation while giving breakout is also giving support to C & H pattern.

Figure.1. Cup & Handle pattern and Buy signal on INDIACEM

1. A close above neckline (Rs 102) of Cup & Handle pattern is indicating a trend reversal.2. Short- term moving average 20 DMA (Rs 99.50), which defines short-term trend, is providing support to buyers as prices are sustained and trading above it.3. Mid- term moving average 50 DMA (Rs 96.15), which defines mid-term trend, augurs well with the bulls as prices are sustained and trading above it.

4. Decent volume participation while pattern breakout will also give additional confirmation.

Profit Booking

Target as per Cup & Handle pattern is calculated by adding the height of Cup to the neckline which comes to Rs 122, however one can book profits near previous swing high which is around Rs 120.

Stop Loss

Entire bullish view negates on breaching of Handle on a closing basis and one should exit from a long position. In the case of India Cements, it is placed around Rs 89 levels.

Conclusion

We recommend buying The India Cements above Rs 102 with a stop loss of Rs 89 for higher targets of Rs 122 as indicated in the above chart.

It's Thursday morning, March 19 — four weeks into the coronavirus crash of 2020. The Dow Jones industrial average has opened down another 700 points, after plunging below 20,000 a day before. It's down 30% in a month, the steepest drop ever, even worse than during the Great Depression.

The fall has been nauseating. Yet I know this is a time to be buying stocks based on rules I've developed over decades of investing. But in order to do that, I have to log on to my brokerage account. When I do, the first number I'll see is the current market value of my portfolio.

Isolated at a farmhouse in rural New York, surrounded by wilderness, I haven't looked in days. I don't want to look now.

I decide I'd better check the weather forecast instead. And then there's email to catch up on. An hour later, I've done nothing.

I'm paralyzed.

I've owned stocks for nearly 40 years. I've lived through, survived and even prospered through four crashes.

So I should be prepared. Yet, looking back at the last few weeks, I recognize that I've violated most of my time-tested rules. Whipsawed between optimism and despair as the bad news mounted and my daily life was upended, I've let emotions influence my decisions. I'm doing it again this morning.

An Unfathomable Fall

I first bought a stock mutual fund during the summer of 1982, as soon as I'd saved enough money to invest. My father, a Cadillac-driving sales manager for NBC's local TV and radio affiliates, had been an avid believer in the stock market, and he'd drummed his faith into me.

It turned out that 1982 was a great year to buy, not that I realized it at the time. For years, I enjoyed the positive reinforcement of a steadily rising market. I loved looking up my mutual fund in the newspaper stock tables. Over the next five years the market tripled.

On Oct. 19, 1987, I was visiting my brother, who was spending a semester in France. When I left my hotel in Strasbourg early the next morning, I noticed the front pages on newsstands carried banner headlines reporting the Dow had dropped “23.” I wondered why the U.S. market was front-page news in France. I looked more closely and saw the 23 preceded a percentage symbol. The Dow had dropped an unfathomable 508 points in one day. On a percentage basis, it was the stock market's worst day ever.

I felt a powerful urge to salvage what was left of my modest savings by selling. But I was far away and had no choice but to hold.

Once I was back in the United States, the market seemed to stabilize. But volatility soon returned. In one of those downdrafts, I panicked and sold my entire fund.

By September 1989, the market had recovered all its losses. I watched from the sidelines, waiting in vain for a good time to get back in.

I vowed to never again trade in a panic. I made a rule — never sell on a down day — and a corollary: Never buy on an up day.

That served me well over the next decade's record bull market, fueled by the tech boom. Times were even headier than during the 1980s. I often overheard personal trainers at the gym boasting about their favorite tech stocks.

The notion of diversification was largely unknown to me. In early 2000, when the tech bubble burst and the next crash came, I was fully invested and stayed that way. I watched as the value of my investments shriveled. I stopped looking at stock tables, which at least provided some psychological comfort. I dropped my monthly paper statements into the trash unopened.

But at least I adhered to my 1987 principle: I did not sell.

In the wake of the two-year bear market, I refined my strategy. I figured that if I bought every time the market average declined by 10% from its previous high — the standard definition of a correction — and then bought some more after each subsequent decline of 10%, then I'd never be buying at the top of the cycle.

I didn't think of this as market timing since I made no prediction where the market was headed. My strategy was a variation of the now widespread practice of portfolio rebalancing — selling some asset classes and buying others to maintain a steady allocation.

I put this system into practice during the 2008 financial crisis. I recall shocked reactions that October when — with the market plunging and others boasting that they'd had the foresight to get out — I said I was buying.

What's Another Virus Scare?

There have been only five 10% corrections since then, and each was a buying opportunity for me. None was followed by a second 10% decline. The last of these corrections came at the end of 2018. As cash built up in my account, I wondered when, if ever, I'd get another such opportunity. I grew impatient. On Feb. 19, the S&P 500 closed at a record high. No one seemed to see a bear market or recession on the horizon, even as stock multiples teetered at record highs and a strange virus began to spread.

Until a week later.

Stocks fell, slowly at first, then gaining steam. By Feb. 25 the S&P 500 had dropped 7.6% from its peak.

So I bought stock (a broad-based index fund) on Feb. 25, jumping the gun on my own 10% buying target. My pent-up eagerness and optimism overwhelmed my disciplined strategy. I didn't make a conscious decision to violate it. I didn't even think about it in my haste to take advantage of what I assumed would be a fleeting opportunity.

Stocks dropped a little more the next day. Then, on Feb. 27, the S&P plunged nearly 5%. Now the market was officially in a correction, its fastest ever, down 12% from the peak the prior week. The coronavirus had spread globally, including to the United States.

I realized I should have waited. I felt foolish and guilty for violating my rules. I vowed not to do it again.

The Biggest Drop Since Black Monday

But how smart I felt the next Monday. The S&P soared nearly 5%, amid rumors the Federal Reserve was about to cut interest rates.

The high was short-lived. By the end of the week, the S&P had erased Monday's gains. By now I was worried, too, but I'm not an infectious disease expert. I figured stocks had priced in the risks. What I did know was that they were now deep into a correction, and so I bought more.

My buying may have been premature the first time, but now I was back on track, sticking to my playbook. At a time of soaring uncertainty on so many fronts, I felt like I was taking charge of my destiny.

That was the last time that buying stocks felt good, like I was pouncing on a fleeting opportunity. It soon became a source of profound anxiety.

Over the first weekend in March, headlines were all about the explosive spread of the virus in Italy. Photos of deserted piazzas drove home the gravity of the situation. What had seemed a distant threat now seemed close to home.

If that weren't bad enough, Russia and Saudi Arabia decided to launch an oil price war just as demand was collapsing. Oil prices plummeted, dragging down the entire energy sector.

I expected it would be a bad Monday in the markets, but it was even worse. Circuit breakers kicked in to halt chaotic trading. The S&P closed down that day by 7%, the biggest drop since Black Monday in 1987.

I summoned the nerve to look at my brokerage account. I was shocked: The stock portion was down far more than the broad U.S. market averages. My international stock index fund was down 20% from its February peak, and the emerging markets fund had lost one-quarter of its value.

On Thursday, March 12, after President Donald Trump banned most air travel between the United States and continental Europe and after economies around the world started shutting down, the carnage in the stock market was even worse than Monday. The S&P dropped 10%, leaving it 27% below its peak a few weeks earlier.

According to my own rules, it was time to buy.

I hardly noticed. I was busy canceling a planned vacation the next week to the Virgin Islands. I began pondering the prospect of my own isolation, something that even a few days earlier had seemed unthinkable.

Worse, a friend in Spain, a healthy 40-year-old I had just visited in November, had fallen seriously ill with the virus. He was in a coma in a Madrid hospital.

Still, during the following days, when I pondered the rush of events during some long walks along a country road, I recognized I was running out of excuses for inaction. I knew I should be buying again, with the S&P remaining well below my 20% target. But trading was more volatile than anything I'd ever witnessed. The S&P logged a record seven straight days of swings of 4% or more.

That Friday, March 13, stock markets staged a late-afternoon rally as Trump promised new measures to contain the virus and shore up the economy. The S&P 500 closed almost exactly 20% below its peak. Still I did nothing.

It was just as well. On Monday, the market collapsed, erasing all of Friday's gains. The Dow fell below the 20,000 milestone for the first time in three years. Markets were now down 30%. It was time for me to buy.

Having skipped the 20% buying “opportunity,” I knew it was time to step up. But I wasn't going to do it on a day the markets had been in free fall. And in any event, I was back to avoiding my brokerage's website.

The next day the stock market jumped higher. I felt a strong temptation to buy, gripped by the notion that the worst might be over. I worried I was missing the bottom by again failing to act on my strategy. But the 30% window had closed, and I reminded myself that my rule is never to buy on an up day.

The next day brought what seemed like good news: New infections in China had dropped to zero. Even so, that morning markets sank, again triggering my 30% buying target. This time I was determined to act.

And yet I dawdled. I checked the news, the weather, my emails. I told myself this was absurd. Whether I looked or not, my portfolio value was what it was.

So I looked. It was bad but not nearly the shock of the last time (perhaps because percentage declines now translated to lower dollar amounts). I still had ample cash on hand as interest and dividends had accumulated over recent years.

So I stepped in and bought.

I won't say I felt euphoric, but I felt better than I had in weeks, at least about my personal finances. I'd mustered the courage to face the truth, however grim. I'd acted according to a plan. I had more cash if needed for the next 10% decline.

My renewed confidence survived the next downdraft, which came the very next day.

The Market Soared. I Felt No Elation.

Nothing I experienced in the past prepared me for the speed of this market crash. The decline after stocks peaked in March 2000 lasted until October 2002 — 2 1/2 years. The most recent bear market, which started in 2007, lasted 17 months. Nobody knows how long this bear market will last.

I take heart from this: During that previous bear market, the S&P was never down more than 50% from its 2007 peak. Even in the Great Depression, the worst bear market ever, the S&P dropped 86%. Small comfort, perhaps, but it never went to zero. And after those steep drops, the market not only recovered but eventually went on to record highs.

This week brought some good news. My friend in Spain emerged from his coma. Doctors say his recovery will be slow, but they're optimistic.

On Tuesday the market soared, followed by two more days of gains. This time I felt no elation. Some of the biggest rallies have come in the middle of the worst bear markets.

My next target is when the S&P falls 40% from its peak. I may be buying again soon.

Note: Here are the top 60 names out of 230 stocks in the Small-cap index that fell 10-40 percent for the week ended March 27.

More than 160 stocks in the S&P BSE 500 index fell 10-30 percent, including names such as Future Consumer, Lemon Tree, Credit Access, KRBL, Future Retail, Welspun India, Bajaj Finserv, and NCC among others.

It was an eventful week for Indian markets with a flurry of stimulus packages from central bankers across the world. The United States government also gave a nod to the $2 trillion packages which was signed by the US President Donald Trump on March 27 and back home, a flurry of stimulus measure were announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das.

The government is trying to address the problem of slowdown which looks imminent. The commentary from the RBI was positive as it assured investors that the central bank is ready to take any measures whenever the situation arises.

The bounce back is encouraging but experts advise not to mistake it with a ‘reversal'. As long as the Nifty50 holds 7,511 which was the swing low March 24, things are likely to stay on the upside, however, a breach of the same could lead to further profit-taking.

""After the US' $2 trillion stimulus, a whopping 9.5 percent of its GDP, Germany granted 21.1 percent of its GDP as a stimulus, and China granted 2.8 percent, India's stimulus quantum looks small, but nonetheless is arriving in piecemeal packets regularly,” Jimeet Modi, Founder & CEO, SAMCO Securities & StockNote said in a note.

""While these are temporary steroids for the economy, nobody can estimate the intensity of the pain that this pandemic and lockdown is going to befall upon our economy and businesses,"" he said.

Modi further added that earnings contraction in the next two quarters is certainly a given with tourism, airlines, hotels, metals, retail outlets not under essential goods getting impacted the most, and investors must not mistake this bounce as a sharp rally, but a normal correction which will face selling pressure at higher levels.

Technical Outlook:

Equity benchmarks continue to trade with high volatility as Nifty during the previous week oscillated in a 1,500 points range and closed marginally lower by 1 percent at 8,660 to extend the decline for a six consecutive week.

The broader markets relatively underperformed as the Nifty mid-cap and small-cap lost 7 percent and 8 percent, respectively. The weekly candle suggests that the selling pressure might just be abating, and the index could consolidate in the coming week.

""The weekly price action resembles thrusting line bull candle indicating abating downward momentum, as Nifty posed a strong pullback after holding 7,500 mark twice during the week, as prices approached deep oversold trajectory after 40 percent decline from all-time high (12,430),"" Dharmesh Shah, Head – Technical, ICICI direct told Moneycontrol.

""Going ahead in the coming truncated week we expect the index to consolidate in the broad range of 9,000-7,800 amid stock-specific action with elevated global volatility aiding the index to bring some stability in the market,"" he said.

Shah further added that a retracement towards 8,000-7,800 (80 percent retracement of last week's gain) should be utilised as an incremental buying opportunity.

Experts and brokerages are of the view that the banking sector should be in the focus of policymakers as the sector is suffering the most and will have a contagion effect on all sectors of the economy.

The government and the RBI understand this and have made a slew of announcements to mitigate the pain of this sector.

The RBI governor on March 27 said the central bank was closely monitoring the situation and will step in whenever required.

“Let me assure you that the RBI is at work in mission mode. We have been monitoring the evolving financial market and the macroeconomic conditions and calibrating its operations to meet any need for additional liquidity support as well as to take other measures if warranted,” said the RBI governor.

The impact

Brokerages highlight that the lockdown of the domestic and global economies due to the COVID-19 threat will have a meaningful impact on banks' loan-book growth.

""We have factored a lockdown of 30-45 days in our revised estimates and cut individual banks' loan growth in FY21 by 3-5 percent and taken deterioration in asset quality. Our earnings revisions are down between 10 percent and 35 percent,"" said brokerage firm Phillip Capital.

The uncertain outlook and the country-wide lockdown has made banks vulnerable to a new leg of asset-quality crisis, with the most uncertain part being the lockdown period and the time that the economy would take to return to normalcy.

""We believe the impact on asset quality would be the least for HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, and DCB Bank, but it would be relatively high for IndusInd Bank,"" Phillip Capital said.

Domestic brokerage ICICI Securities, too, believes that the loan-book growth will take a hit.

""With the lack of any major private sector capex in the current fiscal, system credit growth was largely driven by the retail segment, which contributed nearly 91 percent of incremental credit during the year up to January 2020. We believe COVID-19 may further delay private capex revival and also decelerate the retail loan growth trajectory,"" said ICICI Securities.

""A few banks have already signalled tightening of their retail credit norms. They have also witnessed a decline in credit card spends, which will certainly impact retail loan growth.""

Not only the loan-growth, but the current lockdown will also affect cash flows of borrowers, both individual and corporate which may lead to an increase in corporate as well as retail NPAs.

A decline in loan growth and a rise in credit cost will hit the earnings of the banks.

As per the analysis of ICICI Securities, 5 percent decline in loan growth and 50 bps increase in credit cost may adversely impact banks' earnings by an average of about 22 percent, while 5 percent decline in loan growth and 25 bps increase in credit cost may hit their earnings by an average of 13 percent.

Stocks to watch out for

Banks with stronger business models have a higher ability to sail through this rough tide.

JP Morgan believes HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank and ICICI Bank offer safety with a strong funding base and minimal asset quality risk.

""While forward earnings at this time have low visibility, one can only go by a track record of companies over past down cycles and those that have managed such headwinds (2008 global financial crisis, 2013 taper tantrum, 2016 demonetization and 2018 liquidity problems) should stand out relatively better,"" JP Morgan said.

Phillip Capital has made an assessment of their relative business strength and to gauge which business model has the ability to bounce back faster.

Phillip Capital has upgraded Kotak Mahindra Bank and DCB Bank to a 'buy' with a target price of Rs 1,500 and Rs 107, respectively.

The brokerage has maintained buy recommendations on HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank with revised target prices of Rs 1,110 (Rs 1,420 earlier) and Rs 450 (Rs 660 earlier), respectively.

ICICI Securities prefers HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank, who have a proven history to contain NPAs through credit cycles with high-quality underwriting.

""We like HDFC Bank as nearly 80 percent of wholesale lending is to AA and above, nearly 75 percent of SME portfolio is secured and about 75-80 percent of unsecured loans are to salaried customers,"" ICICI Securities said.

""We will closely monitor BBB portfolio of Axis Bank (13 percent of corporate loans) and corporate & vehicle portfolio of IndusInd Bank from where incremental stress could emerge,"" it added.

edited excerpts:

Q) It was a volatile week for Indian markets, but the good part is we managed to bounce back from 7,511 thanks to the various fiscal measures taken by the government and authorities around the world. What is your take on the market action?

A) In October 2008 when the US Fed had announced a stimulus package, markets rebounded for some time, but thereafter the slide continued. Price destruction was lesser post the stimulus package.

Time-wise it took another 5 months for the market to really begin the bull run. The current actions across the world including lockdowns, stimulus packages, fiscal & monetary incentives will help markets stabilise, but it will take time for markets to enter a new bull orbit. Substantial price correction may not happen, but time correction may happen.

Q) After registering a series on series fall of more than 25 percent in March, what is the sense you are getting for the April series. Do you think we could hopefully close in the positive – what does the data suggest and any stocks which investors should watch/avoid? Have we made a bottom around 7511?

A) April series will be positive given that markets will try and bounce back from oversold levels. As such the lockdown effect will be felt in months to come.

April will most likely be a ""wait and watch"" period. It can close in positive since the markets are deep in the oversold zone, but for the time being, 7,511 can be taken as a bottom in the intermediate-term.

A) The package announced by the government addressed the bottom of the pyramid i.e. 20 percent economic interest; however, 80 percent of the economic interest has not been touched upon.

It is here where the slowdown will have an impact, least to say RBI has only allowed postponement of interest/ loan repayment by 3 months, nonetheless, they will have to be paid.

Therefore, as such government in the name of welfare policies has helped the weaker economic population, but MSMEs, entrepreneurs, businessmen - large & small, organized workforce are left on their own.

A) April may turn out to be a sucker's rally where the fence-sitters will be pulled in. We will see some amount of price stabilizing but a major rally to go past 10,000 on the Nifty is less likely.

A) As such announcements will not have a direct impact on companies, but the Financials sector will get respite.

The RBI has in a way relaxed conditions for NPAs, therefore financials space will stabilize going forward. We would wait for some more time to assess the actual impact of Coronavirus on businesses before suggesting particular stocks for long term investment.

Even more, interestingly, Indian retail investors have also been increasing their exposure to the US markets over the last few weeks.","Based on data from Fidelity and Vested, it seems like investors have been lapping up popular brands such as Apple, Amazon, Tesla, and Microsoft as these mega-caps have tumbled off of record highs.","Viram Shah

It is being said that during this 21-Day lockdown in India, there are two key topics of discussion among people: a) the COVID-19 and the other is, b) markets.

This does seem well justified given the large-scale damage the Coronavirus is causing to people's health as well as in markets.

Fear of the global impact of the coronavirus has sent markets on a downward spiral over the past few weeks. Though the government stimulus announcements helped stage a mini-recovery over the last few days, the Sensex is still down 27.2 percent over the last three months while the S&P 500 is down 18.8 percent.

The S&P 500 hit the lower circuit breaker for the first time since 1997 on March 9th and since then it hit the circuit breaker 2 more times in six trading days.

Given the unpredictability of the economic impact of the coronavirus on companies, institutional investors are looking to move away from equities into safer assets such as US treasuries.

This can be seen in the short-term treasury yields as they turned negative for the first time in more than four years on March 25th.

Given that US government bonds or Treasury bills are the safest assets in the world, they are in high demand during times of volatility.

Retail investors in buy mode:

However, an interesting trend that has emerged during this downturn is that while institutional investors have been rushing towards safer havens, retail investors have actually been calmly buying stocks during this sell-off.

According to data from Fidelity and Vanguard, two of the biggest brokers in the US, their individual clients have shown no signs of panic.

For example, approximately 1 percent of the US Vanguard households traded each day over the last two weeks versus 0.4 percent trading on each typical day.

On March 9th, Fidelity saw a buy-to-sell ratio of 2.11 to 1 even though the market dropped by 7 percent. Even more, interestingly, Indian retail investors have also been increasing their exposure to the US markets over the last few weeks.

For example, at Vested we have seen a 4x increase in funds deposited on our platform during this quarter compared to the last quarter. In the last week alone, we saw a 65 percent increase in weekly accounts opened.

While this increase could be related to investors looking to invest abroad before their annual LRS limit expires on March 31st, a large portion of investors mentioned that their reason to start now is that the crash gave them a good opportunity to start investing in the US market.

What are these investors buying?

Based on data from Fidelity and Vested, it seems like investors have been lapping up popular brands such as Apple, Amazon, Tesla, and Microsoft as these mega-caps have tumbled off of record highs.

Along with these stocks, the index ETFs such as Invesco's Nasdaq 100 ETF QQQ or iShares' S&P 500 ETF IVV has also seen strong interest.

While it is indeed encouraging to see increased retail investor participation during such times, a word of caution – timing the market and hoping to get it right is next to impossible.

It would be prudent to create a well-diversified portfolio and continue to hold it for a long period of time to be able to grow one's wealth over the long-term.

After falling 10 percent on Monday, bulls defended crucial levels of 7,500 which is 50 percent retracement mark from low of 2008 (2,252) and high of 2020 (12,430), giving relief to a sharp fall of almost 3,800 points in March.

Formation of positive divergence in RSI on a daily time frame supported reversing of prices, as index managed to take support from the strong demand zone standing around 7,500-7,300 levels on the higher time frame.

At the same time, Nifty confirmed short term reversal by closing above crucial resistance of 8,600 levels too.

But we need one higher closing on the weekly timeframe as a confirmation before declaring reversal and can start preparing for a push towards 20-DMA placed around 9,600.

On the flip side, a decisive close below strong psychological levels of 8,000 can push index towards the line of parity on a monthly time frame standing around 7,300 marks.

Banking Index has managed to close around crucial psychological levels of 20,000 and 5 day's highest high is suggesting a reversal of short term trend and relief rally towards 25,000 levels cannot be ruled out; conversely, any decisive trading below 18,500 will be a sign of active bears.

Recommendations for the next 3-4 weeks:

DLF | Buy | LTP: Rs 139 | Buy above: Rs 135 | Target: Rs 160 | Stop loss: Rs 117 | Upside: 15%

After hitting a peak of Rs 265, the stock fell sharply towards Rs 115-120. From here, a chance of developing demand is higher.

As of now, the appearance of morning star on the daily chart is giving cues to accumulate this stock at lower levels.

The momentum oscillator RSI which is currently overbought zone took a turn on the north side.

As long as it sustains above the mentioned zone, the possibility of moving on the upside is higher and it can hit our target with ease.

Coal India | Buy | LTP: Rs 131.15 | Buy around: Rs 130 | Target: Rs 148 | Stop loss: Rs 119 | Upside 13%

Bargain hunting is seen at lower levels in the scrip from where it formed a strong base.

Currently, it formed a double bottom on the hourly chart along with the positive divergence in RSI which suggests a reversal is round the corner.

Indicators and oscillators also lending support to the price action. Traders can take an entry from the level of Rs 130 for the target of Rs 148 while keeping a stop loss at Rs 119.

Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) | Buy | LTP: Rs 295 | Buy around: Rs 290 | Target: Rs 315 | Stop loss: Rs 273 | Upside 7%

The stock bottomed out near the levels of Rs 245-250 and has been consolidating for the last few days on the daily chart.

The emergence of Dragonfly Doji near the support line on the weekly chart indicates upside movement in the coming sessions.

Daily momentum indicator RSI seems to be taking support from its falling line while being trading in an oversold region on the daily chart also creating positive rhythm in the scrip.

Furthermore, the declining histogram in MACD adds the conviction of buying the scrip around Rs 290 for the target of Rs 315 with a stop loss at Rs 273.

edited excerpts:

A) The market has bounced back from the lows of 7,511 as stimulus packages were announced in the US and other developed markets.

Also rebalancing in ETFs and pension fund buying support helped the markets rally. The RBI announced an out-of-turn rate cut and measures to improve liquidity in the system.

All these factors helped the market bounce back. With these announcements through the market, sustainability will depend on the behavior of the COVID-19 curve and the new cases.

If the new cases get contained and the curve flattens then the markets will sustain otherwise the markets will correct.

A) April will be a very tricky month. A lot will depend on the lockdown period. If the lockdown period gets over by mid-April then it is very likely the markets will close the April series in positive.

If the lockdown period gets extended to end April or beyond then the markets are very likely to correct. Also, if the lockdown period gets extended then it is very likely that the bottom of 7,511 would be breached.

Q) What are your thoughts on the package announced by the government and RBI? Do you think these are enough to cushion the economic impact of COVID-19 on investors and citizens?

A) The government package of Rs 1.7 lakh crores is not very significant for the markets as it is primarily intended for the needy. The RBI will help the markets as they were expected and announcements have come at the right time.

Bond markets were seeing significant volatility. This will reduce with the injunction of liquidity measures. Overall the measures will provide some cushion to the market and help people to conduct their routines.

A) It is quite tricky to judge whether Nifty will cross the 10,000 mark. At present, it seems difficult as COVID-19 cases have continued to rise.

The number of cases in India will cross 1,000 this week and the next week will be very crucial. The level of community transmission and mortality rate will be quite critical parameters.

Long term investors with good quality stocks should hold on to their portfolios and see through the current storm.
As the volatility is the friend of long term investors by making good stocks cheaper and attractive, the best strategy for retail investors would be to accumulate good fundamental and quality stocks gradually over the next few weeks and months, the brokerage suggests.
""While it is very difficult to predict the bottom of the market, it always rewards investors in the long term who take the benefit of such sharp fall,"" Motilal Oswal said.
As most of index heavyweights and quality stocks turned attractive in valuations, Motilal Oswal picks top 10 ideas which are Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank, Hindustan Unilever, HDFC, Infosys, Bharti Airtel, ICICI Bank, UltraTech Cement, Alkem Labs and Tata Consumer.","Motilal Oswal feels markets may continue to fall in near term, and that's the time to start becoming greedy. Hence the brokerage suggests accumulating on a gradual basis.","The rising fatalities and infected cases worldwide due to COVID-19 has dented market sentiment for nearly one-and-half-month now.

The benchmark indices have crashed more than 38 percent (from their record high seen in January) till March 23, but there was some short-covering and value buying in last four trading sessions due to government measures for poor and daily wage earners, and liquidity stimulus by RBI.

Now the market loss stands at over 30 percent from record highs. Globally, markets fell in the range of 20-30 percent as several industries shut their offices and plants.

With the number of cases surpassing 6.5 lakh and death toll crossing 30,000 mark worldwide, almost all the countries have announced lockdown to control the pandemic. Global activity has come to a halt, disrupting the economy and earnings in a major way.

For the time being, with the 875 active cases and 25 deaths, India's situation is relatively better than others as the government quickly implemented 21-day lockdown (except essential services) effective from March 25. It will definitely have major adverse effects on earnings and economy, but the government along with regulators have been trying hard to minimise the impact.

""A sensitivity analysis of the adverse impact of lockdown on economic activity suggests that real GDP could decline around 3 percent YoY in Q4FY20 while it could decline 12.2 percent YoY in Q1FY21, assuming that things normalise from mid-May 2020. With the first ever two consecutive quarters of GDP decline, the Indian economy could see its first technical recession since 1990s,"" Motilal Oswal said in a strategy note.

The brokerage feels if the economy, however, remains affected for a longer period, the 'self-employed' people (around 52 percent of all employment), and the 'regular wage/salaried workers' (around 23 percent) would also be seriously affected.

Complete lockdown in an already sluggish economic growth environment of India is leading to extremely volatile market conditions, Motilal Oswal said, adding if not contained well, the spread of the virus can have a significant impact on the domestic consumption-driven economy.

According to the brokerage, what makes this slowdown unique is that the policymakers' intervention – monetary or fiscally – will be broadly ineffective in addressing the economic effects unless the COVID-19 subside.

The volatility also increased sharply in last couple of weeks, as VIX hit 86 levels before falling to 70 last Friday. In such conditions, all experts advised traders to be calm and not to panic as high volatility is likely to bring more pressure on bulls, but for long term investors, it is right time to invest in quality stocks.

""Once the virus is contained, markets would stabilise. Long term investors with good quality stocks should hold on to their portfolios and see through the current storm. Traders should refrain taking long positions as all the global markets are in strong bear grip and all the small bounces have been used as selling opportunity,"" Motilal Oswal said.

As the volatility is the friend of long term investors by making good stocks cheaper and attractive, the best strategy for retail investors would be to accumulate good fundamental and quality stocks gradually over the next few weeks and months, the brokerage suggests.

Ace investors always say when the market is falling, it is difficult to predict the bottom, whereas when the market is rising and rising, the top would be difficult to predict. They further say when the market falls sharply, better be greedy and accumulate quality stocks, but when the market starts rising fast with a risk-on rally, the one should be fearful of the rally and better be out of market.

""While it is very difficult to predict the bottom of the market, it always rewards investors in the long term who take the benefit of such sharp fall,"" Motilal Oswal said.

After logging gains for three consecutive sessions, the Indian market witnessed profit-booking on March 27 and Nifty gave away all the gains after facing stiff resistance at 9,000-mark.

Nifty is making higher top higher bottom on intraday charts. As long as the index holds above 8,000, we can expect the positive momentum to continue towards 9,350 than 9,500.

However, the broader structure still looks weak and one should refrain from creating any aggressive long positions.

We have already seen a strong pullback from lower levels, so risk and reward are not in favour of the longs. Although, we are expecting pullback which is unlikely to sustain at higher levels and we may see another leg on the downside once this pullback gets over.

The immediate support is now placed at 8,300 and below that, the index may again slip towards 8,000 levels.

The volatility index India VIX fell for the third consecutive session and it ended near 71 levels; now it has to fall below 50 levels to give comfort to the bulls.

Bank Nifty underperformed Nifty in the previous week and remained under pressure. The immediate resistance is placed at 22,500 levels. Immediate support is pegged at 18,600 and below that, it may drift to 17,500 levels.

Here are three stock recommendations for the next 3-4 weeks:

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) | Buy | LTP: 1,850 | Target price: Rs 1,900-1,950 | Stop loss: Rs 1,770 | Upside: 5%

The stock has provided a breakout from its symmetrical triangle pattern on the intraday chart.

The MACD has also provided fresh buy crossover on the daily chart. Now, it seems like the stock may attempt to fill the gap which is placed at Rs 1,900 levels in the short-term.

Coal India | Buy | LTP: 131.15 | Target price: Rs 139 | Stop loss: Rs 125 | Upside: 6%

The stock seems to be forming a base and is on the verge of a breakout from its rectangle pattern on the intraday chart which is placed at Rs 134 levels.

Above that, a sharp move could be seen towards Rs 144 levels.

The momentum indicator RSI has also reversed from the oversold territory which indicates positive momentum in the stock.

TVS Motor Company | Sell | LTP: Rs 304 | Target price: Rs 285 | Stop loss: Rs 316 | Downside: 6%

The stock has provided breakdown from a rounding top pattern and also making lower high and lower low formation on the weekly scale.

The momentum oscillator MACD is very well in sell mode on the weekly chart.​

Edited excerpt:

Q) Last week was very volatile for the markets, but we managed to bounce back from 7,511. What is your take on the market action?

A) Indian equity markets started the week on a negative note. It started to recover from its recent low. Last week, the US approved$2 trillion stimulus package to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic which helped the market cut some losses.

The Indian market also recovered from its 4-year low after the Indian government announced a $22.5 billion relief package coupled with the rate cut.

This is the wildest time for the market in all kinds of market categories. On 27th March 2020, indices ended almost flat, however banking stocks gained after RBI Governor announced a massive 75 basis points cut in repo rates and 90 basis points cut in reverse repo rate to increase liquidity in the system.

Currently, we are nowhere close to overcoming the COVID-19 crisis. If we see a peak in cases in India and globally for another two to three weeks, (as we saw on Thursday in India when the highest number of people died in a day) then we could see the Nifty dropping back and might possibly even break its recent low. Otherwise, it might rally back to 9,700.

A) The rally which started after 2008 crises to the peak point, the Nifty has retraced nearly 50 percent of the gains from the recent all-time high of 12,430 which was made in January 2020.

The index has declined as much as 32.95 percent in the month of March so far. In April, we can say that Nifty might rally if Corona cases (domestically as well as globally) are in control.

If not, then we could see the Nifty dragging back. Stocks that investors should watch out for are Kotak Mahindra Bank Limited and Reliance Industries Limited.

A) On the last trading session of the week, indices ended almost flat after the RBI Governor announced a 75 & 90 basis points cut in the repo and reverse repo rate respectively to increase liquidity in the system and central government announced a relief package of Rs 1.7 lakh crore to respond to the Corona pandemic.

About 80 crore people will get benefit from the relief package. So, steps taken by the RBI and Indian government are in the right direction.

Apart from this for the fiscal year 2020-21, the government will also increase its borrowing plan. The government is planning to increase gross borrowing to Rs. 7.8 trillion.

A) Recently, the volatility index which is a measure of the market's expectation of volatility over the near term is at the highest level since 2008.

Indian indices were given choppy movement on Friday after RBI Governor announced a massive 75 basis points cut in repo rates and 90 basis points cut in reverse repo rate to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Nifty50 might rally back to 9,700 if corona cases are in control else then we could see the Nifty dragging back and possibly even break its recent low of 7511.

It is of the view that the reduction in China sales resulting from the coronavirus impact is estimated to reduce JLR's full-year EBIT margin by about 1 percent, however, free cash flow in 4QFY20 is still expected to be modestly positive.

Showrooms across major cities and towns have downed shutters choking sales of Bharat Stage IV (BS4) vehicles, auto factories are under lockdown hampering supplies of BS6 upgrades and market sentiments are at its worst with the stock market going back to the levels of early 2017.

Ashish Kyal Founder|Waves Strategy Advisors - wavesstrategy.com Coronavirus hits Indian market! Nifty bounces back but so did China: what is the way ahead?

Heads up! Next low on Bank Nifty might be coming in first week of February

Is Nifty showing signs of topping out? KST indicator has a story to tell Only a few who acted on the advice have been cashing the crash and the rest are occupied identifying the news or events resulting in the drastic downfall. We are facing unprecedented challenges to humanity and existence the way we know it. Given the current pandemic of coronavirus, human survival instincts are challenged. We have been able to flourish on this planet only because of the strong zeal to grow amidst the situations. Case in point is we do acknowledge the gravity of the situation but these are not the times to blame nature or anything else for the financial meltdown but to see what best can be made out of it. We have a history that shows that the best of the ideas and financial institutions came up during the Great depression of 1929! So, during these periods we need to take charge of our trading or investment decisions and see what is working in the current bear market. Now look at the below charts, Do you see any similarity in the fall? Weekly chart:

Let me reveal the secret! The first chart is of Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) from the year 1987 crash and the second chart is of Nifty Index year 2020 so far, Astonished Yet!

This is the power of looking at patterns across the market and time frames. This clearly shows that the pattern and the intensity of fall seen on Nifty is nothing but a repetition of 1987.

Also, it shows that it is Greed, Fear and Hope that results in movement of the stock market and the events only result in short-term volatility or acts as a trigger.

Coronavirus is widely referred to as the only reason for the financial and economic collapse. But, the markets were already exhibiting series of negative divergences and loss of momentum.

The major global epidemic outbreak has been during the extended period of a bear market as pointed out by Robert Prechter, Executive Director, Socionomic Institute.

The stock market acts as a barometer of social mood and the depressed stock market represents a negative social mood. It is during this period that the society is more susceptible to the epidemic outbreaks.

India has just started to catch the Corona fever and the markets have topped out much earlier in January 2020. In fact, the day honorable Prime Minister – Modi announced the 21-day lockdown on 24th March evening, the very next day on 25th March Nifty closed up 497 points – 6.37 percent higher locked biggest gain in 11 years!

Followed by another 4.10 percent gain on 26th March 2020. This has resulted in an up move of more than 1100 points on the index from the lows of 7511 made on 24 March 2020 starting the day complete India lockdown was announced.

The above indicates that freely traded markets move ahead of events or news and any trading decision based on news outflow is like driving a car looking at the rearview mirror.

Events can result in a short-term random movement which can last for a few minutes or hours or days but the original trend eventually resumes!",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/the-untold-story-2020s-nifty-crash-comparable-to-1987-not-2008-5078541.html

"March 28, 2020 07:44 AM IST",1,Nishant Kumar,Kotak advises accumulating these 10 large-cap stocks amid virus-led uncertainty,"Take a look:ICICI Bank | BuyAs per Kotak, the company has seen no major signs of stress in any other retail segment.
Kotak has retained its fair value of Rs 10,200 for Bajaj Finserv.
Bajaj Finance, valued at its RGM-based fair value, adds 74 percent to the SoTP.
We remain buyers; fair Value revised to Rs 300 per share,"" Kotak said.
""These two changes, plus rollover, drive an increase in fair value estimate to Rs 1,475,"" said Kotak.","The gains of the last two consecutive sessions have given bulls some support. However, experts say the market will see a sustained rise only if the cases of coronavirus show a continuous decline going forward.","COVID-19 has shaken the market worldwide. Investor sentiment is unusually low as experts fear the economic impact of the lockdown and widespread coronavirus.

Global brokerage JP Morgan expects about 60 percent of the GDP to be significantly hit by the lockdown.

Deutsche Bank thinks India's GDP growth will collapse in April-June and maybe a negative print of 5 percent year-on-year (YoY) or even more. It said there is a possibility that the July-September real GDP will also be negative.

The gains of the last two consecutive sessions have given bulls some support. However, experts say the market will see a sustained rise only if the cases of coronavirus show a continuous decline going forward.

""The rally was driven by expectations of stimulus measures to support the respective economies and not because of any change in ground realities. A much more stable rally can happen only after any news regarding the virus containment comes in,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.

During times of uncertainty, have a prudent approach in stock picking. A well-calculated move will maximise the chances of gains and minimise the risk if one has a long-term approach, say experts.

Brokerage firm Kotak Securities suggests following 10 large-cap stocks for accumulation. Take a look:

ICICI Bank | Buy

As per Kotak, the company has seen no major signs of stress in any other retail segment. Corporate slippages of Rs 2,470 crore (nearly 4.2 percent of corporate loans) were mainly from outside the ‘BB and below' book (nearly 70 percent of corporate slippages) and were largely driven by stockbroking account (fully provided during the quarter) and a South India-based industrial account.

The estimates of Kotak shows ICICI Bank's net NPL may reduce to about 1 percent by FY22E with slippages of nearly 1.7 percent in FY21-22E. Loan growth may improve to nearly 17 percent by FY21-22E while it expects CASA CAGR of nearly 13 percent over FY19-22E and stable CASA ratio of nearly 46 percent. Calculated NIM may stand at nearly 3.6 percent over FY20-22E.

Kotak believes ICICI bank's RoE is well-positioned for nearly 15 percent or even more in medium term. They have a positive value and value the bank at Rs 615 implying 2.4 times book and 15 times December FY21 EPS.

Bajaj Finserv | Add

With increasing share of protection business (6 percent of APE in FY2019) and non-par savings (18 percent of individual APE in Q3FY20, up from 4 percent in Q2FY19), VNB margins will likely expand, said Kotak.

Kotak has retained its fair value of Rs 10,200 for Bajaj Finserv. Bajaj Finance, valued at its RGM-based fair value, adds 74 percent to the SoTP. It values the general insurance business at 4.5 times book, similar to the valuation multiple assigned to ICICI Lombard. It values Bajaj Life at 1.5 times EV, significantly lower than its peers, as it expects its operating RoEV to remain at 11-12 times.

HDFC | Buy

Kotak believes HDFC's gross stage-3 loans will remain stable around about 1.5 percent over FY21-22E (up from 1.4 percent in FY19) with 49 percent coverage, 17 percent CAGR in AUM over FY21-22E, core NIM to increase to 2.6 percent in FY22E from about 2.4 percent in FY20E.

Moreover, Kotak expects HDFC to deliver 17 percent core earnings CAGR in FY20-22E on the back of 11 percent YoY growth in FY20E. At its fair value of Rs 2,680, HDFC will trade at 2.6 times core book December 2021E (juxtaposed to medium-term RoE of 19-20 percent even as near-term RoE may be lower).

HDFC Life Insurance Company | Add

In Q3FY20, HDFC Life reported a 25 percent growth in VNB on the back of 19 percent APE growth and moderate VNB expansion to 24.7 percent from 23.4 percent in Q3FY19.

HDFC Life remains a highly profitable life insurance company with about 20-21 percent operating RoEV and 20 percent EVOP CAGR during FY2019-22E; this is supported by VNB margins of nearly 26 percent.

Colgate Palmolive (India) | Add

Kotak highlighted that selective price hikes and favorable RM environment cushioned the impact of continued aggression on promotions.

""It is encouraging to note that Colgate has continued its brand investment in Q3FY120 where several of its peers pulled back sharply. Ad spend effectiveness remains low, however,"" Kotak said.

Lower revenue growth, as well as margin assumptions, drive a 6-7 percent cut in our FY20-22E EPS forecasts. ""We keep the faith and retain 'add' even as the street may now prefer waiting for evidence,"" said Kotak.

ITC | Buy

National Calamity Contingent Duty (NCCD) hikes in the Budget, different for different stick lengths implies a portfolio level weighted-average tax/stick increase of around 10 percent, Kotak said.

""Weak 9-months FY20 numbers, NCCD hikes and ability to protect volumes in a poor macro backdrop prompt us to lower our volume assumptions and now bake in a 5 percent EBIT growth for the cigarette business in FY21E versus 9.7 percent earlier,"" said Kotak.

""Valuations are cheap, especially on a relative basis, but unlikely to act as a trigger. We remain buyers; fair Value revised to Rs 300 per share,"" Kotak said.

Titan Company | Add

Even assuming Titan's addressable market is around 50-60 percent of the total jewellery market in India, Titan's share of the addressable market is in the 10-12 percent range, Kotak said.

After Q3FY20 results the company had maintained its guidance of 11-13 percent revenue growth for Q4FY20.

Kotak has now lowered the cost of equity assumption in its DCF by 50 bps to 10.75 percent and also taken up terminal growth rate assumption by 50 bps to 5.75 percent. ""These two changes, plus rollover, drive an increase in fair value estimate to Rs 1,475,"" said Kotak.

Cipla | Buy

Kotak highlighted that Cipla's Goa facility had received a warning letter but its earnings impact is limited given limited new product dependence on Goa.

The impact of the warning letter is not material to FY21 earnings, considering that single source products from the facility account for less than 10 percent of US revenues (nearly 20 percent of US in total) and limited (single digit) approvals linked to the facility over the next 12-18 months.

Cipla management has been highlighting its renewed commitment to the domestic business, which accounts for more than 50 percent of EBITDA. Kotak believes the domestic business should grow in line or slightly higher than the market over the next few years.

Moreover, Kotak sees a strong US generics build-out over FY21-23, given Q4CY20 launch for ProVentil and Q4CY20 partner launch for CiproDex.

Kotak expects the momentum to continue in FY22/23 with potential launches of generic Advair (March 2019 filing) and Abraxane.

Reliance Industries (RIL) | Buy

RIL turned FCF positive for the first time since Q3FY13, with capex declining by 27 percent QoQ to Rs 14.020 crore.

Kotak reiterates a 'buy' notwithstanding a bleak downstream outlook, as the company may benefit meaningfully from plausible consolidation in telecom, the culmination of key transactions, rising FCF trajectory and sustained growth in the retail segment.

Kotak believes higher crude discounts, weaker rupee and potential hike in ARPUs may mitigate lower downstream margins.

Bharti Airtel | Buy

""Bharti is extremely well positioned to benefit from whatever direction industry dynamics take from hereon, in our view. From an execution standpoint, there is ample evidence to suggest that the company is now operating in top gear,"" said Kotak.

""Sharp run up in the past year or so notwithstanding, Bharti remains a solid multi-year compounding play as long as the company and R-Jio resist the alpha-male tendencies in the forthcoming spectrum auctions,"" Kotak added.

"March 28, 2020 08:34 AM IST",2,Kshitij Anand,"'Bulls could return on D-Street if Nifty crosses above 10,000 in April series'","But if the situation further deteriorates from here then the market will again adjust itself in the downside.
We can say that the April series is going to be very choppy with moves on both sides, unlike March series where the market has fallen vertically.
Some public sector utility (PSU) stocks are also looking very attractive as their current dividend yield is much higher than the risk-free rate of return.
If Nifty manages to cross 10,000 levels then we can say that the bear market has been over and it is the start of a fresh bull market.
Hindustan Unilever, ITC, Dabur, Colgate Palmolive, and Nestle are some stocks that could do well if the market sees any kind of strength.","If Nifty can come above 10,000 levels if the situations in front of COVID-19 improves from here because valuations are very attractive at current levels.","Q. A volatile week for Indian markets! But, the good part is that we bounced back from the swing low of 7,511 – thanks to measures taken by the US Fed as well as our own government to help the economy and citizens in these tough times. What is your take on the market action?

A. A roller coaster ride from the last weekend ended almost on a flat note where the week begins with a black Monday but then the market formed a near term bottom at 7,511 levels for a very strong pullback rally which paused after the exact move of 20 percent.

The major problem of the coronavirus (COVID-19) is still persisting where the current bear market rally was on the back of major stimulus announced in the United States and India, therefore, a real test of this rally will be in the next week.

The real test of the low will happen in the coming week as major announcements have already happened, and now the trend in new cases of COVID-19 will dictate the next trend of the market from here.

A. It is very tough to make a call for April series after a brutal fall in March series because there are still lots of uncertainty about COVID-19 where the market has discounted almost worst-case scenario including a lockdown of 21-days. But if the situation further deteriorates from here then the market will again adjust itself in the downside.

We can say that the April series is going to be very choppy with moves on both sides, unlike March series where the market has fallen vertically.

If we see some improvement in the curve of new cases of COVID-19 especially in the US and India then we can say that 7,511 is a bottom for the market otherwise one more move on the downside cannot be ruled out.

In terms of stocks -- healthcare and pharma stocks are looking very lucrative because they will have face any major impact of the lockdown while governments around the world will come with a higher budget for the healthcare sector in the future.

Some public sector utility (PSU) stocks are also looking very attractive as their current dividend yield is much higher than the risk-free rate of return.

A. The government came out with a relief package for the poor while it may come out with a stimulus package for the economy in the future.

If we talk about RBI's measures then we can say that these measures will definitely help in the stability of the financial system and it will also help the financial sector to deal with any liquidity problem.

All measures will be helpful for the economy but the situation of COVID-19 should not deteriorate from here otherwise things will become tough for the overall economy.

A. As I said it is tough to make a call about April month but Nifty definitely can come above 10,000 levels if the situations in front of COVID-19 improves from here because valuations are very attractive at current levels.

If Nifty manages to cross 10,000 levels then we can say that the bear market has been over and it is the start of a fresh bull market.

A. If we talk about recent announcements then it is clear that government is caring about the poor. Hand-outs to the lowest sections of society may result in higher off-take of consumer staples, therefore, FMCG is the sector which may outperform the market as it is also comparatively less impacted by lockdown in the country.

Hindustan Unilever, ITC, Dabur, Colgate Palmolive, and Nestle are some stocks that could do well if the market sees any kind of strength.

"March 27, 2020 03:51 PM IST",1,Kshitij Anand,Experts feel the next round of package could be for the industry,"The relief package is just one of the measures which the government has deployed to cushion the economic impact, but it may not be enough, fear experts.
This is a package for lockdown impacted segments,” Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services told Moneycontrol.
Experts feel that the next round of packages could be for the industry and especially for the sectors such as banks, consumption, hospitality, auto, durables, agriculture, and healthcare.
We spoke to various experts on expectations of the package which could be announced for the industry.
License renewal expansion could also be the kind of Stimulus package.","Experts feel that the next round of packages could be for the industry and especially for the sectors such as banks, consumption, hospitality, auto, durables, agriculture, and healthcare.","Just 36 hours after the 21-Day lockdown was announced, the government unveiled a slew of measures to support the underprivileged section of the society to the tune of Rs 1.7 lakh cr, but experts feel that the second round of package for the industry could be in the offing.

COVID-19 outbreak across the world has disrupted economic activity across the world. The relief package is just one of the measures which the government has deployed to cushion the economic impact, but it may not be enough, fear experts.

Apart from the package which was announced on Thursday, there is a desperate need to support industries like manufacturing, tourism, aviation as well as automobiles. The total cost of the stimulus, including the one which was announced on Thursday, could well be in the range of 1-2 percent of GDP, suggest experts.

The Rs 1.7 lakh cr relief package announced under the ‘Gareeb Kalyan Scheme' is targeted at the most vulnerable sections of the society to support them with food as well as direct cash transfers as the economy takes a halt in the 21-Days lockdown for a period of 3-months.

Also read: Food for poor, cash for needy: 10 key announcements by FM Nirmala Sitharaman

“Comprehensive package for the poor and vulnerable. The focus is ""nobody should go hungry.” No announcements for stimulating the economy. Perhaps later. This is a package for lockdown impacted segments,” Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services told Moneycontrol.

“Regarding relief to MSMEs etc the FM said ""we will look into it. "" So industry-specific measures likely to be announced in the next package. The govt is prioritising. This can go a long way in implementing the lockdown,” he said.

Experts feel that the next round of packages could be for the industry and especially for the sectors such as banks, consumption, hospitality, auto, durables, agriculture, and healthcare.

“A package from the government has to address three broad areas (1) protecting livelihoods, (2) protecting businesses, and (3) strengthening the healthcare infrastructure for COVID-19. To this end, the government needs to provide for viability of businesses and employees which will be at the highest risk from social distancing and lockdown such as hotel, restaurants, transport, entertainment, etc.,” Suvodeep Rakshit, Vice President & Sr. Economist, Kotak Institutional Equities told Moneycontrol.

“The support to these segments could be in the form of cheap credit lines, regulatory/financial forbearance, tax benefits, direct cash transfers, and income supports,” he said.

Rakshit further added that while the cost will depend on the extent and depth of the program as well as the expected time period of a hard lockdown, we pencil in around 2.0-2.5% of GDP as the probable stimulus size that the government may have to look at.

We spoke to various experts on expectations of the package which could be announced for the industry. Here's what they have to say:

Expert: Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services

The package should have direct cash transfer to daily workers, unorganized and farm sectors. The idea should be to restrict job losses in the country, and provide relief to the highly hit sectors and encourage the health segment to handle the COVID-19 issue.

Ease measures is also expected for Banks to manage the risk of an increase in NPA. The size of the package could be about 1% of India's GDP which could be about $30bn, Rs2trn in INR.

Expert: Asutosh Mishra, Head of Research - Institutional Equity, Ashika Stock Broking

We expect stimulus package to primarily address income loss of urban workforce by giving direct cash transfer, free gas cylinders, interest subvention on selected personal loans and higher spending on the healthcare and pharma sector.

Apart from that, we expect a comprehensive package for airlines, hospitality, tourism sectors and export segments, which are worst impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak. Given the level of disruption, we expect a package to be approx 1-1.5% of the nominal GDP.

Expert: Gaurav Garg, Head of Research at CapitalVia Global Research Limited- Investment Advisor

We need to spend money on medical supplies, ventilators, masks and getting protective equipment for medical workers quickly. People are going to lose jobs not only in rural areas but in urban areas also.

In terms of sectors, the government should provide stimulus package for the most impacted ones like Hotels & Hospitality, Tourism, Aviation, Automobile, as these are major employment contributing sectors for the Indian economy and these are some of the worst-affected sectors due to travel bans, social distancing, and suspension of business activities.

As these sectors are having huge debts as well so a loan restructuring scheme could be announced. Apart from this government may allow them for delayed bills payments. License renewal expansion could also be the kind of Stimulus package.

“In other words, the market is already pricing in a 15 percent earnings cut.
Jefferies Nifty-100 stock analysis suggests that approximately 18 percent of stocks (with long enough trading histories) are already trading below their GFC valuations.
Nonetheless, we screen Nifty 100 stocks where valuations are building in c.20%+ earnings cut and RoEs are also 20%+,” said the note.","Sectors like F&B, hotels, tourism, and retail trade (~12% of India's GDP) sees a decline in the activity, said a Jefferies report.","The rise of COVID-19 cases in India and across the world has clouded the economic outlook of the country.

The government response has been swift and relatively strong. The 21-Days lockdown is likely to impact various sectors of the economy significantly.

India has suspended travel (inbound and outbound) and has taken social distancing measures countrywide. These steps will impact the economy significantly especially sectors like F&B, hotels, tourism, and retail trade (~12% of India's GDP).

“Several sectors are building in over 20 percent earning cuts,” Jefferies said in a report. “Our comparison of Nifty 100 stocks' current consensus-based valuations (1 year forward PE or PB as appropriate) shows that several sectors such as autos, energy, financials, industrial, materials & metals, tech, and utilities are now already building a potential c.25-45% earnings downgrade,” said the report.

The consumer sector is still trading above-average valuations with several stocks at a premium of greater than 20 percent on long-term averages.

The recent market decline has taken Nifty PE to 13.3x 1-year forward consensus earnings which is 15 percent below its last 10-year PE multiple.

“In other words, the market is already pricing in a 15 percent earnings cut. While the Nifty had bottomed at much lower PEs (8x) during the GFC or global financial crisis of 2008, we note that the cut to consensus earnings then was 22%,” the note added.

Other market bottoms (Euro-2011, Taper-2013, Yuan devalue-2016, Demonetisation-2017) in the last decade had averaged 13.2x PE.

Jefferies Nifty-100 stock analysis suggests that approximately 18 percent of stocks (with long enough trading histories) are already trading below their GFC valuations.

About 84 percent of the stocks are below 5-year and 78 percent are trading below their 10-year average valuations. “Given that disease spread is yet to peak, it is tough to take a call on the extent of earnings cuts right now. Nonetheless, we screen Nifty 100 stocks where valuations are building in c.20%+ earnings cut and RoEs are also 20%+,” said the note.

Stocks that are trading below GFC lows within Nifty-100 include names like SBI, GAIL, ONGC, NTPC, BoB, and PNB trade below GFC lows.

Among private companies, Adani Ports, ITC, Tata Motors, SHTF, DLF, and Zee Entertainment tops the list of stocks that are trading below the GFC lows.

"March 28, 2020 07:59 AM IST",1,Kshitij Anand,Can't handle volatility? You might regret your decision of panic exit in medium term,"The Volatility Index or India VIX (a widely followed fear gauge) exceeded the level last reached at the peak of the Global Financial Crisis in November 2008.

An exit in a panic now will likely lead to regret from a medium-term perspective.","Harshad Patwardhan

The past month was brutal for the Indian equity markets. The Nifty50 collapsed over 30 percent, making it one of the worst monthly performances ever.

The markets appear to be gripped by extreme panic. The Volatility Index or India VIX (a widely followed fear gauge) exceeded the level last reached at the peak of the Global Financial Crisis in November 2008.

So the panic in the markets has reached a peak. But, is the situation today as bad as what was experienced in 2008?

A problem with assessing damage from the current crisis is that it is not an event but a fast-evolving condition. It will impact both demand as well as supply and it is hard to fathom its extent and duration- leading to fear of the unknown.

Often, when we are in the middle of a crisis; it is easy to overlook the effect of countervailing forces that are unleashed by the policymakers.

We are beginning to see a coordinated monetary and fiscal action by the central bank and the governments. While the Indian markets seem to have shrugged off these measures so far, we believe policymakers are in the mood to do whatever it takes to stabilise the situation.

With so much of negativity, it is also easy to overlook the two positives that have emerged. Firstly, oil prices have collapsed. This is a huge positive for India. It is good for the current account, fiscal balance, inflation and interest rates.

Most importantly, it gives the government much-needed headroom to do targeted spending to tide over the current situation.

Secondly, with a sharp downturn in stock prices, valuations are getting attractive, even compelling in some cases.

Overall, the Nifty for a long time was trading at a premium to long-term trading averages, and is now available at a discount, even after accounting for a potential cut in an earnings forecast.

So, what should investors do? Here is what we think:

While negative emotions are running high, we believe this is perhaps the worst time to exit/redeem equities. An exit in a panic now will likely lead to regret from a medium-term perspective.

While prices have fallen off the cliff, we would caution that it is also risky to invest all your investible surplus at one go. The crisis is far from over and we do not know where the bottom is.

The most prudent and rational course of action is to use the current prices to start investing (given a good risk-reward available) but to do so gradually over a period of time.

He added that the fall is good for long-term investors because India should be able to get back on its feet in a quick time, and the time is right to accumulate jewels of India.

Investors should look at buying the companies where there is a strong business model, and management credibility is very strong.","Investors should look at buying the companies where there is a strong business model, says Shailendra Kumar.","The Indian market might have given a mixed response to the measures introduced by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Friday, but these are strong measures and will help India back on its feet much quicker than other global counterparts, Shailendra Kumar, CIO, Narnolia Financial Advisors, said in the ‘Market podcast' with Moneycontrol.

The bottoming out process for Indian markets has already begun. “We turned positive on Indian markets on Tuesday and the primary reason is that FPI selling is likely to reduce now, which was the primary reason for the fall in the first place,” he said.

Most of the money which was flowing out was the ETF selling and India has a 10 percent weightage in the emerging market basket. With the introduction of the stimulus package from the US Fed, where they said they would buy corporate bond ETF, the move is likely to calm nerves of global investors, Kumar said.

Indian equities, having 10 percent weight in emerging market ETFs, suffered the collateral damage. This high selloff in such a short time span cannot get matching domestic buyers.

This sharp fall in all the liquid investment asset classes happened as most of the corporations and investors moved towards cash (‘move to cash' trades) to tide over the near term pain of a standstill economy.

He added that the fall is good for long-term investors because India should be able to get back on its feet in a quick time, and the time is right to accumulate jewels of India.

“History suggests that humanity has always won, and this too shall pass. No doubt the economy is in a difficult zone and we might be staring at a negative GDP growth in the next quarter. But, the long-term story remains intact and this is the time to buy the jewels of India,” Kumar added.

Investors should look at buying the companies where there is a strong business model, and management credibility is very strong.

COVID-19 is a threat to humanity and damage to the underlying economy is significant. Being the barometer, the equity market has fallen in tandem with this Black Swan event.

But the valuation compression is significant and the market has extrapolated current economic pains even for long-term earning potentials of the companies.

On a simplified basis, any price below the Nifty levels of 9,500 is an undervaluation level, though when the market is not in a normal rational state, it can show us any price but those surely would not be a long term reality.

The most dreadful F&O series of March 2020, fortunately, ended on an optimistic note for the domestic market on March 26.

Nifty recovered sharply in the last three sessions but ended the series with a loss of over 25 percent.

Although it recovered sharply from the lows, the index has been trading in the red for the fifth consecutive week.

Meanwhile, the Nifty Bank index has lost around 3 percent from the previous week and is trading just below 20,000-mark.

Until the previous week, we had a view that the range of 8,000–7,000 can be a place where the market is likely to bottom out.

This was mainly due to the major hidden divergence in the monthly RSI of Nifty. In line with that view, the index has turned after touching the low of 7,511 and is trading 1,000 points above this mark.

At present, the index has managed to close above its short term 5-days exponential moving average for the first time in the last month.

Also, we are witnessing a positive crossover in the daily RSI smoothened oscillator and that too, from a highly oversold zone.

Thus, we are of the opinion that going ahead, a move above 8,750 would help the index to extend the pullback towards 9,500 levels, which is a long way from this average.

Thus, as per the mean reversion theory, the index might move higher to retest the same.

On the downside, the intermediate support is placed at 8,300 followed by 7,900 for the coming week.

A dip towards the same should be used to start picking quality Nifty50 stocks. The bullish view would be negated below 7,400 on a closing basis.

Here are three stock recommendations for the next 3-4 weeks:

IDFC First Bank | Buy | LTP: Rs 21.90 | Target: Rs 26 | Stop loss: Rs 17 | Upside: 19%

In the recent fall, the stock has corrected more than 60 percent from the peak of Rs 48 to end below the Rs 20-mark.

Now at this juncture, the stock has been in a highly oversold condition on most of the time frames.

The stock has found support near Rs 18 mark, which is exactly the 161.8 percent Fibonacci retracement (golden ratio) of the entire rally from Rs 32 of October 2018 to Rs 57 of April 2019.

Traders are advised to buy the stock on the dip from Rs 21 to Rs 19 for the target of Rs 26 with a stop loss of Rs 17.

Container Corporation of India (Concor) | Buy | LTP: Rs 314.35 | Target: Rs 350 | Stop loss: Rs 260 | Upside: 11%

In a matter of fewer than 2 months, Concor corrected more than 50 percent from the peak of Rs 600 and registered the low of Rs 262 in the recent session.

During the process, the stock retested Rs 265-mark, which is the placement of the 100-quarter exponential moving average.

The support of 100-quarter exponential moving average has never been breached since the year 2003 and the stock rebounded sharply from there.

Any dip from here is a buying opportunity for the short-term traders till the stock stays above that level.

Traders are advised to buy the stock on a dip near Rs 290 for the target of Rs 350 with a stop loss of Rs 260.

Infosys | Sell | LTP: Rs 640 | Target: Rs 530 | Stop loss: Rs 710 | Downside: 17%

Recently, there was a breakdown in Infosys below the Rs 630-mark from a pattern that resembled a bearish head and shoulder.

Thereafter, the stock tumbled towards Rs 520-mark and is now again above Rs 630 levels.

The theoretical target of the pattern is placed around Rs 450 and the recent rise could be just a pullback of the fall.

The reward-to-risk ratio looks highly lucrative to go short for short-term traders. Traders are advised to sell the stock on near Rs 650 for the target of Rs 530 with a stop loss of Rs 710.

The March F&O series started with bearish positions as a good amount of shorts got rolled from February. The benchmark indices started correcting from the first trading session of the March series and continued to make lower lows for the major part of the series.

Our market nosedived after an outbreak of coronavirus in India and the volatility index (India VIX) reached a multi-year high of 86.64 levels during the month.

Nifty50 didn't respect any support levels and fell towards 7,500-mark. However, due to some short covering in the last three sessions, Nifty concluded the March series above 8,600 levels, with a loss of 25.72 percent, which is the biggest series-on-series loss since Oct 2008.

The down move was supported by fresh short positions, but most of them are now out of the system as the open interest has declined by 23.88 percent on the expiry-to-expiry basis.

Rollover stood at 62.12 percent, which is lower than its last month and a quarterly average of 77.65 percent and 71.46 percent, respectively. The positions unwinding was seeing mainly due to the new rule to curb volatility and short selling in the market.

Ongoing fall was majorly led by sharp selling from foreign institutional investors' (FIIs) desk as they remained net seller in the cash market segment on all trading sessions of March series and cumulatively sold equities worth Rs. 60,192 crore in March series, which is their biggest selling figure in a month in the last thirteen years.

At the same time, DIIs bought equities to the tune of Rs 54,386 crore. However, FIIs exited some of their short positions in index futures in the March series.

As a result, their ‘Long Short Ratio' in the index futures moved from 13.85 percent to 29.63 percent. On the options front, open interest activity is scattered at 9,000, 10,000 and 11,000 call options; while highest Put OI is at 8,000, 7,500 and 7,000 strikes.

India VIX is still above 70-levels which indicates bear grip and volatile swing could continue in the market. The Nifty's intraday movement of 400-500 points swing could be new normal in such kind of scenario till volatility doesn't cool down from its historical eleven years high.

As of now, the index is light on positions and further build-up will decide the future trend in the market. Going forward, crucial support for Nifty50 is placed at 7,500 and then 6,800 levels. On the upside, the crucial resistance level is placed at 9,600-10,000 levels.

Bank Nifty also started correcting from the initial days of March expiry and continued its negative momentum for the major part of the month. It underperformed the benchmark indices and fell by 35 percent in the March series.

Some short formation was seen in recent fall; but most of these shorts didn't get rolled to the next series as Rollover stood at 55.19 percent, which is much lower than its quarterly average of 71.86 percent.

Open interest also reduced by around 20 percent on a month-on-month basis and as a result, total OI reached the lowest level since Oct 2019 expiry.

At the current juncture, support for the banking index is placed at 16000 and then 14800 levels; while resistance can be seen around 22,000–22,500 zone.

Some banking counters like IndusInd Bank, Axis Bank, Federal Bank, RBL Bank, Canara Bank, and SBI saw severe selling pressure.

Out of these stocks, a good amount of shorts were rolled to April series in stocks like IndusInd Bank, Axis Bank, Federal Bank, and RBL Bank.

On stocks front, we haven't witnessed any noticeable long rollover in any stock. While stocks which added huge shorts and the same got rolled to the next series are Vedanta, IndiGo, IndusInd Bank, Petronet LNG, Titan Company, TCS, Axis Bank, Federal Bank, and RBL Bank.

edited excerpts:

Q) India is going through a 21-day lockdown. What is the way forward for markets?

A) The economic lockdown due to coronavirus is causing investors to factor in the business losses which will keep mounting until such times that this is in place.

Currently, the world is working on a consensus that with a lockdown between 3 to 6 weeks and quarantine measures the spread can be curbed. The 'flattening of the curve' is the strategy now.

This also assumed that with a lockdown a certain amount of economic de-growth will happen. For instance, if India shuts down for 30 days we would lose nearly 5 percent of YoY nominal GDP or about 5 lakh crore.

The governments around the world are trying to bridge this expected gap by giving equivalent fiscal stimulus in sync with monetary policy support. This consensus is likely to get challenged or strengthened in the next two weeks when Europe enters its week 3 and 4 of lockdown.

If it works as it worked for China, South Korea and Japan the markets will probably take that as a solution for now.

But, if it doesn't then a more serious and prolonged slowdown globally and locally will take hold. This is what is battering investor confidence.

A) Markets never become cheap without a crisis. This is an unprecedented crisis but every crisis in real-time seems unsurmountable.

With government action and the indomitable human spirit, this will also pass. This means the currently attractive valuations mean investors should keep their SIPs in place.

Those with a fresh investible surplus should keep adding small staggered amounts to their portfolios. We are advising investors to add between 5% to 10% every week, starting now.

A) This is a typical bear market where all asset classes move together and only cash is king. Most of the inter-market relations break when markets begin to price in recessions.

In developed economies, a recession is now a given and this explains why uncorrelated or loosely correlated assets are also moving together. This isn't likely to persist beyond a few weeks.

A) New investors should start with a sizeable SIP if their equity allocations are very small. This is an ideal time for them to take equity exposure and continue into the future.

A) It's a combination of margin pressure, work from home restrictions where funds want to unwind their trading positions, risk aversion, and pricing in of slowdown across the board.

There are no safe havens in such an environment apart from bonds and the US Dollar which seems to have played out.

A) It does appear that at least two quarters of earnings growth will get cut. This means in the next financial year earnings growth may remain in mid-single digits at best.

A) For equity markets, it's all about earnings and valuations. The most logical way to look at this is that it will start to ebb and markets would price it in. It will cause some sectors to gain and some to lose in the longer term.

New opportunities and market leaders emerge from each crisis and this will be no different. Crisis brings opportunities, stay with equities.

The market may be overreacting on IndusInd Bank after the Yes Bank episode.","The market may be overreacting, especially after the Yes Bank episode. But the task for Sumant Kathpalia - Romesh Sobti's successor - is certainly cut out.","On the day Romesh Sobti's term as IndusInd Bank's Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer ended after 12 years of service, the bank's shares tanked 30 percent.

It wasn't only due to the panic triggered by the coronavirus outbreak. The bank's stock has been falling for a while. Just to give a perspective, in the last one year, the share price fell by over 86 percent—from Rs 1,684 apiece to Rs 235.60 (52-week low). The shares have recovered to some extent since then and are now trading at Rs 301 apiece.

What is so wrong with the bank that the shares are taking such a consistent beating?

""This trend is beyond my analysis. I do not find any reasons why this stock should fall in this manner,"" said Siddharth Purohit, analyst at SMC Global securities.

Purohit's view is reflected in the third quarter earnings card of IndusInd. There are no visible stress on the balance sheet. In Q3 FY20, IndusInd reported 2.18 percent gross NPAs or Rs 4,578 crore, which, in percentage terms, is nearly flat on a sequential basis. Adding the restructured loans part, the gross NPAs come to around 2.27 percent.

The bank has a capital adequacy ratio of 15.43 percent. IndusInd's loan book too doesn't give out any major stress signals. Out of its total loan book of Rs 2,0,7413 crore, only about 46 percent comprises corporate loans. A closer look at the corporate portfolio shows a diversified book with significant exposure to large corporations (25 percent).

Corporate loan book

One of the factors possibly worrying investors could be the chances of some large accounts turning bad in IndusInd Bank's corporate book. IndusInd was one of the banks which had significant exposure to IL&FS, of around Rs 3,000 crore. With no recovery in sight, this exposure has been provided for over quarters aggressively.

The other grey area is the bank's exposure to the telecom sector. IndusInd has about Rs 3,400 crore exposure to crisis-ridden Vodafone. Telecom companies are affected by a recent Supreme Court ruling on Adjusted Gross Revenues payment.

According to Purohit, this too shall pass without harming the bank much.

""Part of the Vodafone exposure has been provided already,"" Purohit said. Now, what about the chunk of loans that could go wrong? IndusInd Bank has 101 accounts in special mention category accounts (SMA), of which SMA 2 (loans that are overdue between 61 to 90 days) constitute only 0.53 percent of loan book as at end of third quarter.

There is a section of analysts who point out the microfinance portfolio of IndusInd. Presently, this contributes around Rs 21,000 crore, or about 10 percent of the loan book. Much of this portfolio is acquired post the amalgamation of Bharat Financial, which was earlier known as SKS Microfinance.

""But there is no major stress in this book. Due to the current environment, there might me some delinquencies but even then, the NPA will be less than one percent,"" said a senior IndusInd Bank official on condition of anonymity. Analysts have had mixed views on IndusInd Bank.

Early this year, UBS in a note cautioned that IndusInd is witnessing a rise in NPAs and about a quarter of loan book could face stress in the next 15 months. But, the consensus among the analysts is that the bank is unlikely to run into a big problem in terms of NPAs except the general industry issues.

Banking analysts think the collapse of Yes Bank and its eventual hurried takeover is taking a toll on other private banks. Yes Bank was recused by a government led bail out after years of mismanagement and careless lending by former CEO, Rana Kapoor. SBI and a clutch of major private banks now hold majority stake in the bank. After Yes Bank's bailout, IndusInd Bank had deferred a meeting to raise capital through AT1 bonds.

The mood among investors and customers is of caution. ""But not every bank is Yes Bank,"" said the officer quoted above.

Succession process

Doubts over the ability of the new leadership under Sumant Kathpalia to guide the bank too may be adding to the uncertainty, analysts said. Kathpalia has been a long-term colleague of Sobti and has been instrumental in building the bank's consumer loan book.

Insiders are confident about Kathpalia's ability to lead the charge.

""Kathpalia is a safe bet for the post. He is also excellent in execution and strategy and has been instrumental in the bank's digitalisation drive as well,"" said the banker quoted above.

The market may be overreacting on IndusInd Bank after the Yes Bank episode. But the challenges for Sobti's successor is certainly huge.

Analysts are keenly watching whether Kathpalia can reinstate the confidence and gain the momentum back. Sobti may continue as an advisor in the bank to make the transition smooth. Kathpalia's first task will be to get the investor confidence back.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/decoding-the-reasons-behind-the-sharp-fall-in-indusind-bank-scrip-5072441.html

The situation points to twin near-term impact for private hospitals, said Edelweiss.
One, social distancing and localised curfews have delayed elective surgeries (60-70 percent of volumes).
Medical tourists, who choose India as an affordable destination for elective surgeries, contribute almost 10-12 percent to private hospitals' revenue.
Apollo Hospitals is likely to get impacted by social distancing, visa cancellations and curfew.","As the situation remains uncertain, the sector is likely to remain under pressure over short to medium term, says Edelweiss.","The 21-day lockdown, cancellation of visas and social distancing will hit all sections of the Indian economy, including hospitals.

The roping in of private labs and hospitals for testing and treating COVID-19 patients was a clear indication that there could be a rise in infections, Edelweiss said, referring to the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.

In India, infections have risen to 562 from 280 cases four days ago and nine people have died.

The situation points to twin near-term impact for private hospitals, said Edelweiss. One, social distancing and localised curfews have delayed elective surgeries (60-70 percent of volumes). Two, visa cancellations have led to a hiatus in medical tourism (10-12 percent of revenue), it said.

Medical tourists, who choose India as an affordable destination for elective surgeries, contribute almost 10-12 percent to private hospitals' revenue. Visa restrictions had dried up this channel, Edelweiss said.

As more people resort to social distancing, healthy individuals are likely to avoid visiting hospitals for routine check-ups and postpone elective surgeries by a couple of months, if possible, it added.

If lockdowns extend through a large part of Q1FY21, the research said, private hospitals' EBITDA would be impacted at around 10 percent for the quarter and 3-4 percent for FY21.

According to the brokerage, the disruption will last till India's brings infections under control. ""There is no accurate way to guess timelines on that, but suffice to say that business as usual for hospitals may be a distant scenario,"" it said.

Edelweiss expects this to dent Q4FY20/Q1FY21 earnings of companies and said revival may be slow as surgery pipelines dry up due to lower out-patient (OP) to in-patient (IP) conversion amid challenged OP occupancy.

OP occupancies, particularly for elective surgeries, are now at an all-time low. Hence, it believes, procedure pipelines are likely to remain dry through H1FY21 and earnings will remain subdued through FY21.

With the uncertainty, the sector is likely to remain under pressure over short to medium term.

It feels onco-specialist Healthcare Global Enterprises has a lower component of elective surgeries and only 5 percent exposure to medical tourism, making it the least likely to be impacted. Hence, it has a “buy” call on the stock.

Apollo Hospitals is likely to get impacted by social distancing, visa cancellations and curfew. The stock, however, remains a top pick, led by earnings resilience and structural growth in diverse businesses, the brokerage said.

Nifty reversed from its new 46-months low of 7,511 on the back of recovery across the globe and also due to short-covering ahead of F&O expiry.

On March 25, the Indian benchmark index witnessed sharp short-covering majorly due to an extremely oversold oscillator and hopes of an economic stimulus package to soften the blow from the lockdown.

After a very long time, the breadth of the market remained in the favour of bulls; for every loser, there were two gainers.

India VIX seems to have temporarily topped out. If it sustains below 70, we will start seeing huge premium decay in Nifty and Bank Nifty and that will confirm the short-term bottom for the market.

Banking Index formed a bullish engulfing candlestick on March 25 which was well-supported with extremely oversold oscillator RSI (14) on the daily timeframe.

This short-term bullish structure can help Bank Nifty to stretch its pullback towards 21,000-mark. One should avoid aggressive buying as most markets in the world are in a bear grip.

The current chart formation suggests if Nifty sustains above 8,000-mark for the next couple of weeks, it will surely create a short-term bottom for the benchmark index.

A break below the said will test 7,500 levels in no time. On the higher side, the index may continue to face hurdles around 8,800 - 9,000 levels.

Here are two stock recommendations for the next 3-4 weeks:

Pidilite Industries | Sell | LTP: Rs 1,256 | Target: Rs 1,100 | Stop loss: Rs 1,380 | Downside: 12%

Pidilite Industries has almost breached its 18-month long rising channel pattern and is currently trading below its support level on a weekly timeline.

Most indicators and oscillators are negatively poised and are looking weak enough to drift further.

The stock has drifted below its 50-day exponential moving average on the weekly timeframe which indicates bears are in full control to push price lower.

On the monthly timeframe, the counter has formed a bearish engulfing candlestick pattern.

Traders can short the stock in a range of Rs 1,265 - 1,275 for the target of Rs 1,100 with a stop loss above Rs 1,380 on a daily closing basis.

Avenue Supermarts | Buy | LTP: Rs 1,899.10 | Target: Rs 2,150 | Stop loss: Rs 1,750 | Upside: 13%

After a steep correction of almost 30 percent from an all-time high level, Avenue Supermarts (D-Mart) is trading near its horizontal trend line support of a weekly time frame.

The 50-day exponential moving average is acting as an anchor point for the stock on a weekly time scale.

The counter has been forming a base near Rs 1,750 for the last couple of days, which is supported by momentum oscillator RSI (14) which has rebounded from the oversold zone with a positive crossover on a daily interval.

Traders can accumulate the stock in a range of Rs 1,890-1,910 for the target of Rs 2,150 with a stop loss below Rs 1,750 on a daily closing basis.

A strong short-covering move pushed Nifty50 back above 8,000 levels while the S&P BSE Sensex is now back above 28,000 which is a positive sign for the bulls.

But, can we say we are out of the woods? Maybe not. Much of the bounce we have witnessed was largely on the back of strong stimulus measures after the US government approved a $2 trillion stimulus package while a similar measure is expected from the Indian government amid a 21-day lockdown.

Most of the investors' portfolios have wiped out about 50 percent of the value and with no signs of a bottom in place, the fall is likely to continue, fear experts. The wild gyrations are likely to continue until some cure is announced.

With Coronavirus cases continuing to rise across the globe, including India, it also threatens the economic activity which could lead to prolonged slowdown not just in India but across the globe. The recession like scenario does not auger well for bull markets.

The COVID-19 is expected to have a severe impact on the economy of the country and India's April-June GDP may fall to negative 5 percent year-on-year or even more, brokerages said.

Fear and panic are not best friends of bulls on D-Street; hence, what investors have to follow in times like this is to remain calm and mentally strong because fear psychosis will make investors commit mistakes which investors should avoid.

The fall seen in Indian markets is in accordance with what is happening across the globe, and this too shall pass, suggest experts because the market is responding to fear. FIIs have pulled out more than Rs 50,000 cr form the cash segment of Indian equity markets so far in March.

“Global markets are correcting due to the spread of the pandemic virus and sell-off in the Indian market is on similar lines with other emerging markets. As markets don't like uncertainty, investors are looking to sit on side-line and be in cash till the clarity emerges,” Hemang Kapasi, Portfolio Manager – Equity Investment Products, Sanctum Wealth Management Private Ltd told Moneycontrol.

“Markets are reacting to fear hence it is difficult to predict an exact bottom. A lot of businesses are available at multi-year low valuations, people with longer-term horizons should invest in a staggered manner to take advantage of these prices rather than try to predict the bottom,” he said.

Markets, the world over, are clearly unnerved by the likely impact of the coronavirus on the global economy. Morgan Stanley has already warned about a likely recession-like scenario in its base case scenario. Industry after industry is being affected, and the major economies of the world, be it the USA, China or Europe, all are feeling the heat of the virus threat.

Govt to face Rs 10 lakh crore shortfall in FY21 due to COVID-19: SC Garg

MGNREGA works will resume in non-containment zones in efficient manner: Narendra Singh Tomar “Investors are advised to not exit from their mutual funds at current levels, as already the major indices have corrected by over 30% and individual stocks, in many cases have corrected by even 50% or so,” he said. Singh further added that selling off in panic is definitely not the way forward, in such times of uncertainty. It will help you separate the men from the boys, which then can be put to good use in the future as well. We spoke to various experts and here is a list of 10 stocks which are looking attractive after the recent breakdown in markets: Brokerage Firm: Kotak Institutional Equities Infosys: Buy The brokerage firm slashed FY2021-22E revenue by 5-7 percent and EPS by 10-11 percent as we build the impact of COVID-19 pandemic globally. It forecast revenue decline of 0.9 percent in FY2021E and expect EBIT margin to decline to 20.6 percent. Normalization of growth is likely to happen by FY2022E. Post 32 percent correction in stock price, Infosys trades at trough multiple. The stock was upgraded to buy from add on – (1) attractive valuations; we valued Infosys at normalized multiple of 16X FY2022E earnings resulting in fair value of Rs 680 (Rs 810 earlier) and (2) wallet share gains and excellence in execution will ensure that it remains in the top percentile on growth.



The stock was upgraded to buy from add on – (1) attractive valuations; we valued Infosys at normalized multiple of 16X FY2022E earnings resulting in fair value of Rs 680 (Rs 810 earlier) and (2) wallet share gains and excellence in execution will ensure that it remains in the top percentile on growth. Bharti Infratel: Buy The sharp recent correction has brought down Bharti Infratel's EV to 3.9X 3QFY20 annualized EBITDA. Even as we appreciate the sharp, immediate risk to this EBITDA from further consolidation in the wireless market, Kotak believes some of the EBITDA lost will be recouped on the back of (1) higher tenancies from the surviving operators and (2) higher rental/tenant driven by the sliding rental structure. It upgraded to buy (from reduce) with a revised face value of Rs 185/share. The revised face value reflects a 2+1 wireless market structure. Apollo Hospitals: Buy Kotak expects Apollo Hospitals to benefit from an improving maturity profile, even as the near-term outlook is challenging given a lower volume of international and domestic travel patients, as well as deferment in OPD footfalls and elective surgeries, though, a full demand recovery in 2HFY21 is likely. Kotak cuts FY2020/21 estimates and upgrade to buy with a revised fair value of Rs 1,820/share (versus Rs 1,840/share). United Spirits: Buy Kotak upgraded United Spirits to buy from reduce with a fair value of Rs 660. United Spirits has executed well on premiumization and non-COGS cost optimization over the past few years notwithstanding a weak demand environment and raw material headwinds. Even as demand environment remains challenging (especially ST impact of COVID-19), raw material prices have stabilized and valuations have turned attractive. Cummins India: Buy Kotak upgraded Cummins India to a buy from reduce based on (1) our assessment of earnings downgrade cycle being largely behind us, (2) diversified mix of businesses helping chug through current uncertain times and (3) reasonable valuations at sub-17X trailing earnings. The brokerage firm lowered fair value to Rs 520 from Rs 590 on 11 percent cut in estimates and lower 18X multiple. Prospects from the shift of business to Cummins India from China and from revision in domestic emission norms provide defence against unforeseen negatives in the base business. Brokerage Firm: YES Securities ABB India: Buy ABB is banking on increased traction in smart factory, remote monitoring, data centers, process industries, F&B, life-cycle management and urbanization as its expertise in the core sector is the key differentiator for digitalization solution. ABB is a key supplier of critical electrical equipment like motors, transformers, rectifiers, inverters, etc. systems to rolling stock manufacturers around the world. With Indian railways moving swiftly towards the procurement of electric locomotives, the brokerage firm believes ABB is likely to see strong business momentum over the next 3 years. Birla Corporation - BUY Birla Corporation has brought down RM costs in Chanderia plant by Rs175-200/te through improved mining efficiencies and curbed purchase of outside clinker/limestone. Consequently, the RM costs/te of standalone cement business (BCL) was flat over FY14-FY19 despite a 7-12 percent annual increase in fly ash, slag and gypsum cost. Colgate-Palmolive (India) - BUY Colgate India is the leading oral care company in India, with ~53 percent volume share in the toothpaste category and 45 percent share in the toothbrush category. The company enjoys strong brand equity and takes a proactive approach to product innovation, and deepening distribution reach should keep it in good stead over the medium term. It expects the margin to fare better in FY22E backed by select price hikes, better mix and a modest increase in Ad spends. After Market share loss of ~5 percent in the last 4 years, market share loss has been arrested and can perhaps move higher in the next 3-4 years after moderation in the growth of naturals toothpaste sub-segment normalizes. Currently, the stock is trading at an undemanding valuation of 24x FY23E P/E.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/strong-short-covering-helps-market-reverse-the-direction-10-stocks-look-attractive-5062001.html

"March 25, 2020 05:10 PM IST",2,Nishant Kumar,HDFC Bank shares surge 12%; Morgan Stanley says the stock is well positioned in uncertain times,"Morgan Stanley in a report on March 23 said the stock is well placed in uncertain times.
This is allowing the bank to take a disproportionate share in various high margin businesses,"" Morgan Stanley said.
Depending on the duration, this will negatively impact earnings owing to moderation in loan growth, lower margins, slower growth in fee income and higher NPLs.
However, Morgan Stanley sees these being partially offset by lower variable costs and higher treasury gains (given lower bond yields).
On growth, Morgan Stanley expects the strong trends to continue, beyond the current COVID-19 outbreak and estimate 18-20 percent loan growth over the next three to five years.","The current selloff in the market has hit this bluechip stock too as the stock has fallen 30 percent since February 1, in sync with the benchmark Nifty which is also 30 percent down for the same period.","Snapping the losing run of the last three consecutive sessions, shares of HDFC Bank ended with a strong gain of 12.41 percent at Rs 863 on NSE on March 25.

The current selloff in the market has hit this bluechip stock too as the stock has fallen 30 percent since February 1, in sync with the benchmark Nifty which is also 30 percent down for the same period.

HDFC Bank is still among the top picks of many brokerages.

Morgan Stanley in a report on March 23 said the stock is well placed in uncertain times.

""Structurally, HDFC Bank is in an extremely sweet spot, we believe. It has the lowest cost of disintermediation and there is almost no balance-sheet stress, unlike most of its competitors. Moreover, the bank has been a front-runner in digitisation and has improved its product distribution capabilities in interior India (branches, CSC tie-ups, merchant acquisition points). This is allowing the bank to take a disproportionate share in various high margin businesses,"" Morgan Stanley said.

The global brokerage firm has an 'overweight' rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,285.

""After the sell-off, valuations are below the global financial crisis (GFC) lows and pricing in material stress on earnings, we believe. Uncertainty as to the duration of the lockdown will keep the stock volatile, but we see attractive risk-reward given a strong balance sheet, improved profitability and high growth potential.,"" said Morgan Stanley in a note.

HDFC Bank's recent initiatives are performing well and have the potential to drive sustained growth of more than 20 percent as the economy stabilises, Morgan Stanley underscored.

""We view payments, expansion into semi-urban and rural markets (SURU) and MSME as strong growth engines where profits can grow at 20-25 percent annually over the medium-term,"" Morgan Stanley said.

The global brokerage highlighted that over the past few years, the bank has improved digitization capabilities, strengthened distribution and accelerated deposit share gains.

As an output, the bank is already seeing accelerated customer acquisitions, a pickup in loan growth in SURU markets, and strong growth in payments, distribution fees and MSME loans, Morgan Stanley said.

The sharp increase in social distancing measures amid COVID-19 could have a material impact on HDFC Bank's earnings.

Depending on the duration, this will negatively impact earnings owing to moderation in loan growth, lower margins, slower growth in fee income and higher NPLs. However, Morgan Stanley sees these being partially offset by lower variable costs and higher treasury gains (given lower bond yields).

Morgan Stanley believes the stock's returns could be very strong over the next 2-3 years and said that the earnings compounding beyond the next few quarters will remain strong at a CAGR of over 20 percent, while valuation normalisation merely to historical mean levels would drive more than 100 percent upside over 2-3 years.

On growth, Morgan Stanley expects the strong trends to continue, beyond the current COVID-19 outbreak and estimate 18-20 percent loan growth over the next three to five years.

There has been a lot of noise from those claiming to be pro-markets about keeping the capital markets open, despite the daily free-fall of the indices.

How much more pain can the Indian retail investors take? With markets being highly volatile, the pain is felt highest by the retail investors as they cannot get out as quickly from the markets as Institutional investors can.

Look at the data of the proportion of retail investors in any major stock. It has increased not due to their love of those stocks, but due to the institutional investors exiting those stocks before the retail investors could!

Retail investors do not have access to the depth of research or options of using algo-trading that most of the institutional investors have.

With the fiscal year-end looming around in the next few days, the DIIs and FIIs will exit to stop losses or book profits, further!

Also, there would be arguments by some economists, that we as an economy are free markets, hence, should not stifle the market by shutting it.

Arguments have been made about capital markets providing liquidity. Yes, but at whose cost or capital? The current economy reminds me of the adage “Return OF capital is more important than Return ON capital”.

We are not a mature financial market. Or a deep economy yet.

So the folks who get hurt the most in a volatile growing economy are the retail investors.

For an economy, where financial instruments had been few in number, we have used the concept of cash, gold, real estate.

Slowly over the past 2 decades, we had built consumer confidence in our bourses to participate in equities market investments. The mutual fund industry has been doing yeomen service in building consumer confidence.

However, in the past few years of structural shifts with the introduction of demonetisation, RERA, GST and the past 2 years of liquidity crisis in the economy, fixed deposits & equities (direct or through Mutual funds) have been seen as a safer alternative to investing option.

With banking industry having its own imagery issues due to NPA clean-up, FDs started moving to PSBs. Typically, in mature capital markets, intra-day fall is not high.

The rally further extended in 2020 as well. As on February 25, the stock was up 510 percent from the listing price at record closing high of Rs 1,951.95. But thereafter it fell 56 percent from highs.

The reason behind rally seen before correction was its monopolistic position in railway ticketing, drinking water and catering services to railways, whereas the fall in last one month was entirely due to novel coronavirus-led global turmoil and lockdown in country.

""IRCTC is bracing for a hit on operational profitability as Covid-19 has brought travel & tourism activity to a complete standstill. Pre-Covid, on an average around 8.5 lakh tickets were booked each day. However, the figure has declined to around 5.5 lakh tickets per day due to delay in travel plans,"" Prabhudas Lilladher said.

Given that passenger train services are completely suspended and leisure travel will take time to pick-up the figure can go down further, according to the brokerage.

""In addition, on-board catering and services of tourist trains including the newly launched Tejas Express have also been suspended for the time being. Sales of packaged drinking water will also take a hit given the lockdown type scenario,"" it said.

Its sensitivity analysis revealed revenue foregone/operational expenses burn (largely fixed in nature with some variable component) can be in the region of Rs 262.5 crore/Rs 45.9 crore if there is a complete lockdown for one month.

But despite near term challenges, Prabhudas Lilladher believes IRCTC is best placed to bounce back once Covid fear resides as structural levers remain intact. ""The stock currently trades at 13.6x FY22 EPS and looks attractive with a long-term perspective. Retain buy.""

However, the brokerage said it would advise staggered buying and did not rule out near term weakness given the constantly evolving situation over lockdown.

""Further, risk of reduction/abolishment in service charge has magnified as Covid is a black swan event and government can take a socialist approach to deal with the current situation,"" it added.

Prabhudas Lilladher estimated the impact on IRCTC's earnings if there is a 1-month complete lockdown. ""In case of suspension, total revenue foregone can be in the region of Rs 262.5 crore per month and the operational expenses burn (largely fixed in nature with some variable component) could be in the region of Rs 45.9 crore per month.""

""Total revenue and EBIT impact in ticketing business can be in the region of Rs 65-70 crore per month and Rs 55-60 crore while fixed cost that will hit P&L during the suspension of services will be around Rs 10 crore per month,"" it explained.

In case of catering segment, revenue forgone per month could be Rs 117 crore (simply divided full-year revenue by 12) as it is difficult to predict seasonality, and there could be Rs 27.2 crore per month impact on Rail Neer revenue, it said.

""Tourism revenue forgone per month will be Rs 48.3 crore (simply divided full-year revenue by 12); however, the figure could be higher as Q1FY21 is peak season for travel,"" it added.

IRCTC is debt-free with a cash balance of Rs 1,160 crore as of December 2019. Thus, it can tide over the current crisis without leveraging the balance sheet, the brokerage feels.

The macro-economic effects of COVID-19 and its effects consequently on portfolio management are far-reaching. Due to the expected hit on global demand, crude oil is likely to slump further.

As a result, any company with crude oil linkages should benefit from margin compression provided they are at least able to just maintain top-lines.

Other sectors such as tyre, FMCG and downstream OMC companies stand to benefit from improved FCFs thanks to potential margin uptick.

Home Décor companies which used to face competition from imports from China (Tyres as well here) would also likely benefit from supply disruptions there.

In the long run, should COVID-19 pandemic prevail, stocks with safe-haven characteristics would be the go-to avenues?

IT Sector (preferably domestic-focused as most have relatively high foreign exposure that is linked to current muted demand), staples (except where there is no element of meat consumption), utilities and high dividend yield stocks can be attractive candidates.

In terms of direct risk, pharma companies that are not vertically (and backwardly) integrated could be at risk. Companies with significant exposure to China (such as certain Indian auto companies playing globally), and Commodity/Metal players could see some dent.

Consumer Electronics manufacturers that are reliant on China for providing them the basic components are another at-risk segment as are travel and related sectors.

At times like these, investors still having some dry powder left should focus on staggered and selective deployments with a strict and disciplined hawk-eye focus on both prices and valuations as this stands the test of time.

The current valuations looking at the past few years are certainly attractive, but correctly ascertaining the current true potency of the virus and the speed of its antigenic shift (mutation) vs. the speed with which the human immune system evolves to combat it remains an unknown.

Long-term investors should use the market weakness and build positions in undervalued stocks. Central banks have sprung to action with innovative methods of providing liquidity.

In the long run, equity markets should recover as global supply chains recover and demand sentiment picks up.

"March 26, 2020 10:17 AM IST",1,Kshitij Anand,"Hunt for multibaggers: For some investors, race to become crorepati has begun","For the last two years, stock markets are flat but the last two weeks have been horrible.
""On the other hand, new investors are flocking to stock markets like never before.
In 20 years of my stock market experience, I have never seen so many people opening accounts.
Indian stock market, too, found itself in a bear grip and registered a similar fall of more than 30 percent from its peak in mid-January.
We have seen few investors who were willing to deploy money in the markets, however this has remained largely few and scattered,” he said.","An analysis of Google Trends suggests that interest in the term 'multibagger' is nearing the peak, which historically comes when market is going through a correction.","Are you also looking up on the internet for multibaggers? You are not alone. An analysis of Google Trends shows that the interest in 'multibaggers' is nearing the peak, which historically happens when the market is going through a correction.

The last time when it hit a peak of 100 was in April 2019. The Nifty50 corrected from 11,856 and made a low of 11,108 on May 14 before bouncing back.

A multibagger is a term used for a stock that has more than doubled in value over a time period. So a stock that has clocked 100 percent returns is a 1-bagger, 200 percent is a 2-bagger and so on.

If you input a keyword in Google Trends, it shows the historical interest in the term on a scale of 0 to 100, relative to the highest point on the chart for a given region and time. A value of 100 is the peak popularity.

The data also corresponds to new accounts, which have been opened recently. It looks like new investors have already made their base to generate multibagger returns, given the fact that we are trading at three-year lows.

The recovery on D-Street, according to most experts, will be swift but a complete recovery could take some time. The returns are likely to remain muted for 2020, largely due to the economic fallout of the coronavirus outbreak in India and across the world.

“Smallcase Technologies has seen an increase in its new investor numbers in March. They have seen a 3.5x increase in new account leads in March MoM, a 1.5x increase in new investors in March MoM, and 1.6x increase in orders in March MoM,” said a report.

“There is definitely negativity and pessimism. For the last two years, stock markets are flat but the last two weeks have been horrible. It started with Yes Bank fiasco, which impacted thousands of small-time retail investors, followed by global meltdown because of Covid-19 and sharp fall in crude oil prices,” Prakarsh Gagdani, CEO, 5paisa.com, told Moneycontrol.

He said existing customers were selling their positions, booking losses and some were also redeeming their mutual funds. ""On the other hand, new investors are flocking to stock markets like never before. This trend is unprecedented. In 20 years of my stock market experience, I have never seen so many people opening accounts. Young millennials who have never tasted markets are coming in big numbers to invest which is a very good sign and also a silver lining in these bad times,” he said.

Nithin Kamath, Founder& CEO, Zerodha, shared the view. “We are also adding new clients at the fastest rate ever, which is even more surprising given the market conditions. This shows maturity on part of the investors,” he said.

Waiting for the right opportunity:

Indian markets are down by about 40 percent from record highs but investors are waiting for more clarity before putting in a lumpsum. However, most investors are continuing with their SIPs which is heartening.

We are in a bear market which has led to negativity and pessimism on D-Street. And if you thought that the last two years were largely flat, take a look at the last two weeks – they have been horrible.

“Currently, Indian Indices are in the bear market territory (a condition where indices tumble more than 20 percent from a recent high). According to the historic data, an index which is in the bear market territory might take 18 to 36 months on an average (to recover),” said Gaurav Garg, Head of Research at CapitalVia Global Research Limited- Investment Advisor.

During the 2007-08 recession, the indices took more than 15 months to recover. ""The recovery process will be slow, and investors should wait for the right opportunity. If a portfolio is down by 30-40%, recovery might take at least 18 months,” he said.

Garg further added that investors should stay with quality stocks and keep a watch on coronavirus turmoil as economic conditions, demand and supply would be the key factors in determining the recovery timeframe.

Global equity markets have tumbled in the last one and a half months as coronavirus infections have spiralled across the world. India hasn't been spared either. Foreign institutional investors have pulled out more than Rs 56,000 crore in the cash segment of India equity markets.

US markets have fallen more than 35 percent from its recent peak, ending one of the longest winning streaks -- of 11 years-- in market history. Indian stock market, too, found itself in a bear grip and registered a similar fall of more than 30 percent from its peak in mid-January.

“FIIs have been on a selling spree, having sold equities worth more than Rs54,000 crore in March alone. While DIIs have put up a brave front by buying equities worth Rs46,000 crore in the same time, they have remained ineffective in controlling the sharp fall in the markets,” said Ajay Menon, CEO, Broking & Distribution, Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.

“The majority of the retail investors who were already invested in the market did not get the opportunity to exit as the fall was quick and sudden. We have seen few investors who were willing to deploy money in the markets, however this has remained largely few and scattered,” he said.

Confidence had been badly shaken and investors were not sure when the markets will turn around, Menon said, adding they were willing to wait out before trying to accumulate.

The Association of National Exchanges Members of India (ANMI) on March 23 requested the capital market regulator SEBI to shut down exchanges if state governments do not declare broking and depository operations as essential services.

Track live updates on coronavirus: PM Modi puts India under 21-day lockdown

Most states are in a lockdown and a few under curfew to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus, as reported infections in India near 500. The country has, so far, reported 10 deaths.

Last week, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) announced a slew of measure to bring down volatility but D Street ended up recording its worst fall history in absolute terms on March 23. The Sensex plunged by about 4,000 points, while the Nifty was down by more than 1,000 points.

Closing down stock exchanges would be disastrous for markets, say experts, as it would mean a complete loss of reputation and confidence from a global standpoint.

To ease some pressure, SEBI has come out with measures to reduce the compliance burden on various market participants.

“The penal provision for non-collection/short collection of margins by brokers has been deferred till April 30, 2020. These penal provisions were to be implemented from April 1, 2020,” SEBI said.

The delay in submission of various reports by trading members would not attract penal provisions till April 30, 2020, it added.

Moneycontrol spoke to few brokers and they said it was business as usual for them, though most of the employees were working from home.

Employees are using teleconferencing and video conferencing apps. Brokerage firms say they have adequate business continuity procedures in place to ensure smooth functioning.

Here's what top brokerage firms have to say:

Expert: Vineet Agrawal, Chief Financial Officer, Angel Broking Ltd

These are unprecedented times. A real force majeure situation at hand. We at Angel Broking are addressing this with extreme caution. For us, the health and safety of our employees and other stakeholders is paramount.

Since early last week, we have most of our employees working from home, with very few and extremely critical roles being managed onsite, strictly adhering to required health and safety measures. We have provided all required digital tools to our employees so they can continue working seamlessly even from home.

Employees are using teleconferencing and video conferencing apps for all communications. We have adequate business continuity procedures in place and operational to ensure uninterrupted continuity of business for our clients.

Since the majority of our business happens through digital interfaces today, the impact due to intensifying physical lockdown measures for us is minimal, whilst we continue to abide by the directives of the government and regulators in letter and spirit.

Expert: Nithin Kamath, Founder & CEO, Zerodha

Our entire 1200+ member team is working from home since March 12. Today we are fully digital and we've transitioned seamlessly without any hitches. Nothing changes for our clients, they have complete access to all our products and services and it is business as usual.

5paisa.com has about 5 lakh customers, and barring 5–10 people who are required to carry out critical operations, rest of the company is working from home. We have tried to provide the entire infrastructure required to work from home to our employees.

From an investor standpoint, there is nothing to worry because the stock market operations will continue as usual. Our 99.9% turnover happens online and hence customers can easily trade on their mobile app sitting in their homes. Though we recommend investors to exercise caution while trading in these testing times.

Expert: Ajay Menon, CEO – Broking & Distribution, Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd

Our first and prime concern today is meeting investors/clients' needs and at the same time our employees and their families' health and well-being. We as an organisation are intricately woven into the financial lives of our clients and the larger capital market ecosystem, it is important to ensure uninterrupted service.

Giving uninterrupted service to access capital markets in these times of uncertainty and doing so without compromising the health of our employees and partners is a challenge that we have been preparing for and monitoring execution over the last 15 days.

Except for critical employees in our operations, dealing, IT, security and administrative functions, we have ensured that most of our employees across businesses are working from home and they are provided with access to all tools and critical systems such that they are able to maintain a connect as well as serve all their internal and external customers.

Most analysts feel oil marketing, paint and tyre companies gained the most as crude oil is their direct raw material for their products.
""Amid volatile crude prices, oil marketing companies (OMC), paints and tyre sector will be benefited most.","The steep fall in oil price is definitely positive not only for India which imports around 85 percent of requirement, but also companies which use as their raw material in any form.","Oil prices have been hit hard due to low demand after novel coronavirus or COVID-19 forced the world to either go on lockdown or partial shutdown. Oil prices are at their lowest level since 2003.

The price war raised by Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil producer, after OPEC and its allies failed to agree on production cuts last month also put a lot of pressure.

International benchmark Brent crude futures dropped to $24.68 a barrel intraday on March 23, the lowest since April 2003, down 65 percent from its 2020 peak seen in January. Today at the time of writing this copy, oil price gained 3.44 percent to trade at $27.96 a barrel amid hopes that the United States will sign a $2 trillion stimulus deal to support the economy from COVID-19.

The steep fall in oil price is definitely positive not only for India, which imports around 85 percent of the requirement but also for companies which use as their raw material in any form.

We spoke to analysts to find out what are those sectors or stocks to get benefitted from falling oil price.

Most analysts feel oil marketing, paint and tyre companies gained the most as crude oil is their direct raw material for their products.

""Amid volatile crude prices, oil marketing companies (OMC), paints and tyre sector will be benefited most. We would recommend buying paint

and selective tyre companies in this turmoil. We would recommend investors to refrain buying OMCs from current levels as demand may decline due to coronavirus outbreak globally,"" Gaurav Garg, Head of Research at CapitalVia Global Research Limited- Investment Advisor told Moneycontrol.

AK Prabhakar of IDBI Capital also said normally oil marketing companies were going to benefit, while paint and tyre sectors will also be benefited as crude is the raw material for them.

It will also benefit the auto sector in general as low price induces to buy vehicles, but as the virus forced to do lockdown, everything comes to a standstill and no demand to auto also.

Further, stocks from FMCG and consumption will also benefit the most from sharp falling oil prices as raw material and packaging cost will be lower, Anand James, Market Strategist at Geojit Financial Services said.

He feels this fall is going to be a growth multiplier and in fact will be applicable to all sectors when the market will begin recovery.

In terms of stocks, Gaurav Garg recommended buying tyre maker Balkrishna Industries and paint company Asian Paints which are attractively valued.

According to Vineeta Sharma, Head of Research at Narnolia Financial Advisors, in the falling crude prices scenario, HPCL and Asian Paints are two stocks that may be accumulated now.

""The falling crude prices will reduce the burden on oil marketing companies on subsidy front. Also, HPCL's earnings visibility looks attractive on the back of its capex plans,"" she said.

""HPCL's expansion projects at Mumbai (from 7.5mtpa to 9.5mtpa + residual upgrade project, Rs 4,200 crore capex) and Visakh (from 8.3mtpa to 15mtpa, Rs210bn) refineries are on track for completion by FY21E. The company is available at a dividend yield of 3.5 percent. We recommend buy on HPCL with the target price of Rs 240,"" she added.

In case of Asian Paints, she said the company which began commercial operations of new plants at Vizag and Mysuru had attained 75 percent capacity utilization by Q3FY20.

""Volumes of the company may remain impacted due to poor global- domestic macros. However, falling crude will boost gross margins of the company and cost rationalization measures will further support profitability. ROE is expected to improve led by margin expansion and improving asset turnover. We recommend buy with target of Rs 2,060 per share,"" she added.

Asian Paints corrected 21 percent, Balkrishna Industries 45 percent and HPCL 32 percent from their highest closing of 2020.

In fact, the benchmark indices itself lost more than 37 percent from their record highs seen in January, which clearly indicated that valuations supressed to large extent.

AK Prabhakar feels Reliance Industries, the operator of world's biggest refinery complex, is also the major beneficiary of falling oil price as it buys crude in bulk for its refinery. The stock already corrected 44 percent from its 2020 high on concerns of COVID-19, impacting oil demand.

""Once the COVID-19 subsides, the demand along with benefits of IMO fuel regulations impact will improve benchmark gross refining margins (GRM),"" said Yes Securities.

RIL's retail business has witnessed a very strong momentum in the past few years led by significant expansion in stores and an even stronger like for like growth across segments, it added.

""During FY19-22, we expect RIL to witness an earnings CAGR of 20 percent. Return on equity is likely to improve by 200bps and debt/equity is expected to reduce from 0.7x to 0.4x during the same period. Considering this, we find FY22E EV/EBIDTA of 6.3x attractive,"" the brokerage said, adding expected increase in ARPU and constant addition to its subscriber base will aid Jio business.

Edited excerpt:

Q) There is plenty of fear on D-Street. Sensex and Nifty are now trading below their crucial support levels. What is the way forward for the markets amid the spread of COVID-19?

A) Global markets are correcting due to the spread of the pandemic virus and sell-off in the Indian market is on similar lines with other emerging markets.

As markets don't like uncertainty, investors are looking to sit on side-line and be in cash till the clarity emerges. Markets are reacting to fear hence it is difficult to predict an exact bottom.

A lot of businesses are available at multiyear low valuations, people with longer-term horizons should invest in a staggered manner to take advantage of these prices rather than try to predict the bottom

A) Companies generally declare dividends during the second half of the financial year. Public sector undertakings announce dividends towards the end of fiscal to aid in shoring up government revenues.

Additionally, some companies might be giving dividend early to take some tax benefits

A) Considering the fall is so sharp in prices if promoters feel that the value of their business is currently below the long-term intrinsic value and the balance sheet of the company supports doing buyback than it's a very good opportunity to maximise shareholder value by doing a buyback.

A) During times of uncertainty investors prefer to be in a safer asset class where preference moves towards the world's reserve currency which is US dollars, Dollar Index is at 10 year high.

Having said that Indian Rupee has performed inline or better than other emerging markets currencies. Rupee depreciation benefits export-oriented companies and sectors like Information technology, Chemicals, and Pharma which have a sizeable export business.

But, demand for exports in the short term is again going to be weak. While companies having dollar-denominated debt would be impacted due to Rupee depreciation

A) History may not repeat but it does rhyme. Every fall is not the same but similar. It is a good time to pick up businesses having longevity as prices are attractive.

But, investors cannot expect to reap benefits immediately as markets don't like uncertainty.

Backing the prime minister's decision on the lockdown through a tweet, Chauhan said: “The entire country is with you to save India's future. We will do the 3 weeks nationwide lockdown ourselves.""

In another tweet, he said the daily operations of BSE will continue as usual putting speculation to rest on whether the market will function during the lockdown.

India has so far reported close to 500 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and ten deaths, and the total number of Coronavirus cases across the world is nearing 400,000.

Indian markets bounced back on Tuesday after registering its worst day in absolute terms in previous trading sessions when both Sensex and Nifty50 fell by about 13 percent.

Let's look at the final tally on D-Street – the S&P BSE Sensex rose 692 points to 26,674 while the Nifty50 gained 190 points to close at 7801 on Tuesday.

Track live updates on coronavirus: PM Modi puts India under 21-day lockdown

Reacting to the announcement, VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services said: ""Enforcement of the 21-day lockout of the nation will be a major challenge. Ensuring supplies to all households is not going to be easy, but has to be done. The temporary shock to the economy will be huge. But if we come out of this lockdown successfully, economic recovery can be sharp. The choice in this crisis is limited. That's why the PM said, if we don't do this 21-day lockdown, we will go back to 21 years. Effective practical enforcement of the lockdown will require massive support from the central govt including income support to poor households, forbearance on NPA classification, EMI repayment etc. This will come, as the FM said earlier in the AN, sooner than later.""

Earlier in the day, the Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman might have disappointed those who were waiting for a stimulus package, but announced a slew of measures to support the economy, traders, businessmen, and the common man.

However, to calm the nerves of D-Street, Finance Minister categorically said that relief measures will come sooner than later, and the current announcements are also part of that plan. She further added that there is no need to impose a ‘financial emergency' as was claimed by some reports.

Giving assurance to the market, FM assured investors and market participants said that the government is closely monitoring the situation.

Amid the measures initiated by the government most brokerage firms are operating at minimum capacity including BSE; hence, the business operations would continue as usual.

However, many market participants, as well as industry bodies, have spoken in favour of shutting down the exchanges to counter the volatility that has pushed both benchmark indices—the Sensex and the Nifty-- below crucial support levels.

The Association of National Exchanges Members of India (ANMI) on March 23 requested the capital market regulator SEBI to shut down exchanges if state governments do not declare broking and depository operations as essential services.

Closing down stock exchanges would be disastrous for markets, say experts as it would mean a complete loss of reputation and confidence from a global standpoint.

“These are unprecedented times. A real force majeure situation at hand. We at Angel Broking are addressing this with extreme caution. For us, the health and safety of our employees and other stakeholders is paramount,” Vineet Agrawal, Chief Financial Officer, Angel Broking Ltd told Moneycontrol.

“Since early last week, we have most of our employees working from home, with very few and extremely critical roles being managed onsite, strictly adhering to required health and safety measures. We have provided all required digital tools to our employees so they can continue working seamlessly even from home,” he said.

Employees are using teleconferencing and video conferencing apps for all communications. We have adequate business continuity procedures in place and operational to ensure uninterrupted continuity of business for our clients.

Nithin Kamath, Founder & CEO, Zerodha said that his entire 1200+ member team is working from home since March 12.

“Today we are fully digital and we've transitioned seamlessly without any hitches. Nothing changes for our clients, they have complete access to all our products and services and it is business as usual,” he said.

Morgan Stanley in its note to clients said that multiple indicators suggest a bear-market trough, but it is tough to call absolute bottom with precision, but it's close on many metrics.

The search for the elusive bottom continues. Morgan Stanley's Ridham Desai writes in his note to clients that while it's not possible to call an absolute bottom with precision, the market could be nearing it, based on many metrics.

Morgan Stanley has cut its Sensex EPS growth for the third time after the virus outbreak and now expects it grow 10 percent, down from the earlier forecast of a 20 percent growth.

The broking firm has added BPCL, Bajaj Auto, Bajaj Finance, ICICI Prudential, and Titan to its “Focus List”. It has dropped Bharat Electronics, Indian Hotels, M&M, M&M Finance and NTPC from that list.

The global investment bank has raised positions in financials by 300 bps, Energy by 200 bps, and materials by 200 bps. It trimmed position in technology by 300 bps & industrials by 400 bps.

Recently, Tata sons had bought shares of Tata Motors, Tata Power, and Tata Motor DVR as per the reports available.
Yes, the recent fall will be a big opportunity for the promoters and cash-rich companies to increase their holding in the company.
A) Out of Nifty 50 stocks, 45 stocks have touched their 52 week low in March (Upto 20, March 2020).
This fall was similar to Dec 2010 to Jan 2012 and Feb 2015 to Mar 2016, at that time market fall more than 20% and steep bounced back from low levels.","Equities are available quite low priced as compared to the valuation of the stocks. Recently, Tata sons had bought shares of Tata Motors, Tata Power, and Tata Motor DVR as per the reports available.","The recent fall will be a big opportunity for the promoters and cash-rich companies to increase their holdings in the company, and buyback from the market will be helpful to arrest the sharp declines and stabilise the price of the stock, Jashan Arora, Director, Master Capital Services, said in an interview with Moneycontrol's Kshitij Anand.

Edited excerpt:

A) It would be too early to say that a major bottom has formed. Although, the market has corrected near 80 percent of the previous move from (6825-12430.50) the volatility remains high.

We can assume that very short term support may have formed near 7,900 levels. The monthly and weekly trends are bearish and the bears have control over the market.

A pullback cannot be ruled out and the market may fall further to retest or break the low or form a higher bottom.

A) Before the new Budget proposal, which takes effect from April, companies are rushing to pay dividends to shareholders which makes dividend income taxable up to 43 percent in the hands of the recipient.

At present, shareholders in the country need not pay any tax on income from dividends from domestic companies for up to Rs 10 lakh while they have taxed 10 percent for dividend income beyond Rs 10 lakh.

After the abolition of DDT, the taxpayer of dividends will have to pay according to their respective tax slabs, which are as high as 43 percent.

To abolish DDT on dividends paid by corporates has been proposed in the Budget 2020 and transfer the tax burden completely in the hands of the recipient.

A) Now, equities are available quite low-priced as compared to the valuation of the stocks. Recently, Tata sons had bought shares of Tata Motors, Tata Power, and Tata Motor DVR as per the reports available.

Yes, the recent fall will be a big opportunity for the promoters and cash-rich companies to increase their holding in the company. Buyback from the market will be helpful to arrest the sharp declines and stabilise the price of the stock.

A) By the rise of dollar's price fears of a global credit crunch were exacerbated, in turn contributing to broad-based selling of stocks and other assets, with even traditional havens such as gold and U.S. Treasury under pressure.

That adds to demand for dollars, creating a vicious loop. For instance, On an FX-hedged basis, many non-U.S. investors own U.S. equities.

When equity market cap declines, they are left with oversized hedges, and bringing the notional value of hedges down therefore generates USD buying IT and Healthcare stocks are likely to benefit from the fall in rupee.

A) Out of Nifty 50 stocks, 45 stocks have touched their 52 week low in March (Upto 20, March 2020). Nifty and Sensex both lodged a fall of more than 35% from the January month peak.

This fall was similar to Dec 2010 to Jan 2012 and Feb 2015 to Mar 2016, at that time market fall more than 20% and steep bounced back from low levels.

So, swift recovery is likely in the markets. It is challenging to predict the bottom, but the best approach for the investors to accumulate fundamental strong and quality stocks on dips.

ICRA highlighted that the bank had witnessed high slippages from the stressed book and recognised slippages until March 14, 2020, in the Q3FY2020 results, for which it made accelerated provisions in its Q3FY20 results, leading to the depletion of its capital ratios.

After the equity infusion and write-down of the AT-I Bonds, Yes Bank's capital ratios were likely to improve with CET-I and Tier I of 7.6 percent and 7.8 percent, respectively, and CRAR of more than 9 percent, ICRA said.

The news about the finance minister holding a press conference took Nifty50 above 8,000 levels on hopes of the announcement of a stimulus package during the day.

The indices lost momentum when the FM said the stimulus package is underway.

Benchmark indices witnessed selloff in the last one of the trading session as there was no announcements about a stimulus package. But, most of the announcements on GST, taxation, as well as MSME sector is positive for the economy.

“Amidst the lockdown, extension of deadlines and relaxation of norms brings in great relief to the taxpayers and businesses in the country. The relaxation of bank charges is also a welcome step. More measures including cash transfers are expected in the coming days,” Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit financial services told Moneycontrol.

“The focus should be on the low-income earners, as they are the worst hit from the lockdown. Removal of minimum balance on bank accounts will be helpful particularly for the poor sections. Raising the threshold for IBC to Rs 1 cr is a succor for the struggling MSMEs,” he said.

In the next trading session if the index manages to defend 7511 levels on an intraday basis then eventually it can pave the way for further short covering on expiry day.

If 7500 is breached then the downswing shall initially get extended towards 7350 levels and below that 6850 can't be ruled out, suggest experts.

Pull back attempt bulls shall face their initial challenge in the zone of 8159 – 8200 levels and strength can be expected on a close above 8200 levels.

Giving assurance to the market, FM assured investors and market participants said that the government is closely monitoring the situation.
We are monitoring the stock market,” FM told reporters.
""Relaxation of board meetings by 60 days for the next 2 quarters is effectively giving relaxation to corporates to gradually work towards audited results.
However, experts are not convinced that we have formed a bottom, and there are chances of further correction on D-Street even if a stimulus package is announced.","The call for a big stimulus package has become louder because many economists across international rating agencies have lowered their growth forecast for India,","The Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman might have disappointed those who were waiting for a stimulus package, but announced a slew of measures to support the economy, traders, businessmen, and the common man.

However, to calm the nerves of D-Street, Finance Minister categorically said that relief measures will come sooner than later, and the current announcements are also part of that plan. She further added that there is no need to impose a ‘financial emergency' as was claimed by some reports.

Indian market which got off on a positive note tracking strong global cues build momentum in the second half of the trading session ahead of the FM press conference but saw mild profit booking towards the closing.

""Market seemed to breathe a sigh of relief today after the crash yesterday, in sync with the global markets. In addition to the huge relief package by the US Fed yesterday, there were also expectations of a fiscal package by the government,” Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told Moneycontrol.

“Market came off its highs after no significant announcements by the FM and the fact that the economic package was still in development. European and US manufacturing activity data due later, which may indicate the impact of Covid-19 on economies, could influence markets tomorrow,” he said.

Giving assurance to the market, FM assured investors and market participants said that the government is closely monitoring the situation. “SEBI has come up with guidelines and stated its position on the recent volatility. We are monitoring the stock market,” FM told reporters.

“On the financial market, the FM said all the regulators and RBI and MoF are working together to monitor the development of the market. We are consciously monitoring the stock market thrice in a day. A lot of inputs have come, the task force is also looking into them,” she said.

Finance Minister also gave relief to small-to-big corporates in terms of GST return filing, reduction in interest rates, holding board meetings for quarterly earnings, default under IBC etc.

The call for a big stimulus package has become louder because many economists across international rating agencies have lowered their growth forecast for India, and analysts at top brokerage firms have slashed their earnings forecast amid slowdown led by COVID-19 outbreaks across 190 countries.

The relaxation on TDS and GST for all companies is a positive development for the market. It is effective funding at 0.75 percent per month which will aid cash flows and give breathing space to MSME, small-cap and mid-cap companies to manage their cash flows better, suggest experts.

""Relaxation of board meetings by 60 days for the next 2 quarters is effectively giving relaxation to corporates to gradually work towards audited results. However, instead of this, I would have preferred to allow online / web-based participation of directors for board meetings rather than requiring the physical presence for all board meetings,” Vinay Pandit, Head Institutional Equities, IndiaNivesh told Moneycontrol.

""The relaxation under IBC for MSMEs is a big positive for BFSIs and NBFCs. Expect banks and especially NBFCs to react positively and sharply to this positive announcement,” he said.

Pandit further added that he expects positive reactions in Axis Bank, IndusInd Bank, Bajaj Finance and Bajaj Finserv along with other NBFCs focused on MSME lending.

Way ahead for markets:

It looks like the market is factoring a worst-case scenario and is near a bottom. For now, the swing low of 7511 recorded on March 24 will be crucial support and below that 7000 and 6800 levels are likely to lend support.

However, experts are not convinced that we have formed a bottom, and there are chances of further correction on D-Street even if a stimulus package is announced. The big positive for D-Street would be any news about a cure around COVID-19.

“FM made some announcements regarding relaxation on compliance-related issues which will be beneficial for public as well as for the companies but it won't have any meaningful impact on the market while announcement regarding any economic package will have a significant impact on the market and FM has tweeted that economic package will be announced soon,” Santsoh Meena, Senior Analyst, TradingBells told Moneycontrol.

“The ultimate trigger for the bulls will be any positive news in front of Coronavirus. It is difficult to say about the exact bottom with high confidence amid such uncertain environment but I think the Market has discounted almost worst-case scenario and we are probably near to the bottom,” he said.

Meena further added that global markets are showing some signs of strength where if the exponential curve of coronavirus cases flattens out amid lockdown in India as well as around the world then we can expect a smart recovery in the market in the coming days.

Technically, the Nifty50 which witnessed a relief rally formed a High Wave kind of pattern on the daily charts which offer some hope for the bulls.

“A high wave-type candlestick pattern was formed on the daily chart at the new swing low of 7512 levels. This pattern signals some hopes for bulls to make a comeback from the lows. But, there is no confirmation of any bottom reversal at the lows as of now,” Nagaraj Shetti - Technical Analyst, HDFC Securities told Moneycontrol.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/keep-calm-mr-market-stimulus-package-is-coming-sooner-than-later-5067291.html

Morgan Stanley highlights 20 stocks in the focus list which include names like Bharti Airtel, Baja Auto, Maruti Suzuki, Motherson Sumi, Titan Company, Godrej Consumer and ITC, among others.

The Indian market, which has plunged by about 40 percent from the recent peak, might be still away from an absolute bottom with precision, but it's close on many metrics, Morgan Stanley said in a note.

“Our proprietary sentiment indicator is at its lowest level ever suggesting completely broken sentiment for stocks, historical VaR is at a new high, change in realized volatility is the highest for any bear market, and valuations are skirting with all-time lows and well below the levels hit during the global financial crisis,” it said.

This bear market is only two months whereas bear markets generally last at least 6 months. Given the pace of the decline, it may not be following the past average duration.

“The price decline of around 40% also leaves some more downside risk on the table when compared with past bear markets,” said the Morgan Stanley note. The global investment bank recommends investors buy stocks of quality businesses where prices have corrected sharply.

After hitting the lower circuit in intraday trade on March 23, the Indian market saw some recovery on March 24 with Nifty ending above 7,800-mark, taking cues from firm global markets.

Additionally, the market sentiment strengthened as the Finance Minister told media that the economic package to help through the coronavirus lockdown is being readied on priority.

However, on the technical front, Nifty and Bank Nifty are still not showing strength as prices are holding well below its short and long-term moving averages on broader charts.

Nevertheless, some technical bounce back after a steep cut in prices is always expected but rising volatility index with fears of COVID-19 among global investors will likely keep bears on the front foot as of now.

As far as levels are concerned, 8,000-8,100 levels are key resistance levels for the Nifty which should cap any sharp upside.

Here are three sell calls for the next 3-4 weeks:

Siemens | Sell | LTP: Rs 1,018.85 | Target price: Rs 780 | Stop loss: Rs 1,170 | Downside: 23%

Last week, the stock went below its 200-days exponential moving average on weekly charts placed at Rs 1,195 levels and since then we have witnessed a series of decline into the prices.

On the daily charts, the stock is maintaining its downtrend and can be seen trading in a sloping channel with the formation of a lower bottom pattern.

At the current juncture, negative divergences on secondary oscillators suggest further downside into the prices in the coming sessions once again.

Traders can take a short position in the stock in the range of Rs 1,020-1,050 for the downside target of Rs 780 with a stop loss above Rs 1,170.

Pidilite Industries | Sell | LTP: Rs 1,272 | Target price: Rs 1,080 | Stop loss: Rs 1,400 | Downside: 15%

For the last three months, the stock has been consistently maintaining its bull run and has been rising high with the formation of a higher high and higher bottom pattern on the daily and weekly intervals.

However, this week it fell sharply from its highs and slid below the rising trend line of the channel to close well below its 200-days exponential moving average on the daily charts.

The break down below the rising channel pattern can trigger a further selloff in the stock, going forward.

Traders can take short positions in the stock in the range of Rs 1,280-1,285 for the downside target of Rs 1,080 with a stop loss above Rs 1,400.

Tata Steel | Sell | LTP: 271.90 | Target price: Rs 210 | Stop loss: Rs 310 | Downside: 23%

The stock has been beaten down sharply ever since it has broken its 200-days exponential moving average on the monthly charts which is placed at Rs 388.

Since then, the stock has fallen nearly 28 percent and is now trading around Rs 271. At the current juncture, some consolidation can be seen in the prices after a steep fall, which has formed a descending triangle pattern on the daily charts.

This week, however, the stock has once again given a sharp breakdown below the pattern formation which can trigger the next round of selling.

Traders can take short positions in the stock in the range of Rs 270-275 for the downside target of Rs 210 with a stop loss above Rs 310.

A) The impact on earnings is going to be significant, very significant.

Edited excerpts:

Q) The Sensex broke below 30,000 to hit a new three-year low in the week gone by. An enormous amount of wealth has already been eroded. What is causing this panic in the market?

A) Markets have been fairly volatile in the last few sessions, as investors are jittery and quite understandably so. What started as a major health scare is now starting to take a toll on the economy as well.

Sectors like entertainment, aviation, hospitality, discretionary consumption and financials are just some of the sectors that will see significant negative earnings impact in the current and the coming quarters. This is the first cause for investor concern.

Secondly, the uncertainty of timing--how long will this crisis last-- is again something that remains at the top of everyone's minds. The element of uncertainty adds to the panic.

Third, valuations, in pockets, were already getting expensive and a correction was anyway due. However, we believe, that the greatest of businesses are best bought in the worst of times.

It's times like these to build a portfolio of great businesses with a long-term investment objective to create significant wealth. Breaking the cycle of fear in such times is essential to building a strong equity portfolio.

Q) What will you tell those who are left with bleeding portfolios, even if they have invested in mutual funds?

A) The advice would be simple–first and foremost, do not panic. It never helps. Then, one should re-assess the entire investment portfolio, irrespective of asset classes it comprises of, in light of returns, your own risk appetite and optimal allocation.

The primary thing to remember is that quality always pays in the long term. Reassign your investments to reflect this. If the company is a leader with some measurable competitive advantages in a growing market, then the risk-reward in such situations is quite favourable in these times too.

Q) Gold, oil and equities are all moving in one direction. How should investors read this?

A) Well, it tells us that investors are panicking and dumping all asset classes. Such a situation typically arises every few years when confidence is completely shaken. The need of the hour is to maintain composure and keep investing in quality.

Q) Many investors want to take advantage of the fall in the market but have no firepower. What would advise--start a small SIP?

A) The thought process is correct but needs a slight modification. Rather than buying anything, many fairly high-quality names are now available at very attractive valuations.

One should be thinking of long-term portfolio building in these times. That's what we at Ambit Asset Management believe.

Q) FIIs have been pulling out money from markets across the globe and India is no exception. What is troubling FIIs? Is it the margin pressure redemption, ETF selling or just the smart money moving to safe havens?

A) The issue at hand is that all major global economies are either in a shutdown mode or heading there. This has led to a flight to safety. Equity markets are heading southwards and bond yields are rising across geographies.

Q) With recession fears looming, investors should say goodbye to an earnings recovery for at least two quarters. What is the kind of earnings cut you are factoring in?

A) The impact on earnings is going to be significant, very significant. Hotels, airlines, auto, all kinds of discretionary consumption are all going to see massive earnings cuts.

However, we do believe that most of this has now been factored in to the price. I doubt anyone is expecting anything, in terms of earnings growth in the next couple of quarters.

However, the thing to keep in mind is that all this is temporary and things will recover from here. So, no need to panic.

Q) Some analysts say that the coronavirus outbreak is nothing like that what financial markets have faced, so the outcome, too, would not be similar. Does that mean that one should stay away from equities?

A) No, I disagree. Look at China and how quickly they have been able to control the situation. The governments, both central and state, have been quite proactive.

I do believe that the situation will come under control sooner than what most people are expecting. Hence, the impact on financial markets shall be short-lived and more so for quality names in equity markets.

Q) Which are the fundamentally strong stocks that you think are worth buying?

A) Without getting into specific names, all I would say is that one should head to quality. Several large-cap names are now available at distress valuations - I would suggest investors construct a portfolio of these names - something on the lines of our Coffee Can PMS.

Large-cap, market leader and no corporate governance issues.

Technical picture:Technically, the Nifty50 witnessed a bloodbath on the D-Street yet again after a short-covering session on Friday.",Experts feel that considering the fact the Nifty50 is trading near crucial support levels a technical bounce back could be seen while some support is placed at 7200 followed by 6800 levels.,"Fear has a new name, it is now known as Covid-19 or coronavirus. Equity markets seem to fall at the same speed with which Coronavirus is growing across the world dismantling the economic systems as more and more cities face a shutdown.

The S&P BSE Sensex and Nifty50, which hit a lower circuit on March 23, witnessed their worst day in history as the coronavirus spread disrupted businesses and sent several states into lockdown.

India has reported 415 cases of the coronavirus but health experts have warned that a big jump could be imminent, which would overwhelm the underfunded and crumbling public health infrastructure, said a Reuters report.

Reacting to the lockdown in India as well as weak global cues, the Indian market failed to hold onto crucial support despite measures taken by the market regulator, Sebi last week to reduce volatility.

SEBI halved position limits for certain stock futures, restricted short-selling of index derivatives and raised margin rates for some shares to curb “abnormally high” volatility, said a Reuters report.

The S&P BSE Sensex and Nifty50 were down by about 13 percent in just a single trading session. Fearing the worst, most experts the fall is likely to continue as cases of Coronavirus continue to grow including in India.

As most experts await for a stimulus from the Indian government, most portfolio investors are sitting on a notional loss of more than 40-50 percent of their portfolio which could be either in mutual funds or stocks.

Picking stocks is not easy as most of them have corrected by more than 20 percent. But, amid the gloom and doom scenario which is being painted, the survival of the business comes in question.

For Nifty, the next big support is placed at 7,300 levels, but looking at wild gyrations seen in the market, no support is sacrosanct.

“This is clearly one of the worst phases the whole world is undergoing at present. Not only in terms of financials or economies but also in terms of a health crisis. This uncertainty due to coronavirus pandemic is weighing down heavily on markets across the globe and it was yet another day of carnage for Indian markets,” Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives, Angel Broking told Moneycontrol.

“We reiterate in such type of environment, no analysis works and rather than focusing on conventional theories of the stock market. As far as levels are concerned, 8000 now becomes a crucial hurdle, and since we are trading at multi-year lows and no support is being respected, we refrain from mentioning levels as the number is decided on the next course of action,” he said.

Time to become greedy?

Well, the valuations do look ripe from a bottom-up basis, but experts feel that investors should remain selective while picking stocks. Even after falling 30 percent from the highs, the Nifty50 has not made a bottom which is concerning.

Most investors either are scared and the ones who have some cash are scared of a further selloff in the markets. Well, Indian markets will continue to fall till the time we see some stabilization in Covid-19 cases across the globe or announcement of a vaccine.

“The increase in domestic shutdowns to contain the virus also weighed on the sentiment. India has shut over 75 districts along with bus and railway services to restrain the pandemic,” Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Retail Research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services Private Ltd told Moneycontrol.

“The steep correction due to the coronavirus impact has made many good stocks cheaper and attractive. The best strategy for long term investors would be to accumulate good fundamental and quality stocks gradually over the next few weeks and months,” he said.

Khemka further added that while it is very difficult to predict the bottom of the market, it always rewards investors in the long term who take the benefit of such a sharp fall. “Markets may continue to fall in the near term, and that's the time to start becoming greedy. We suggest accumulating 10-15% of overall allocation on a gradual basis,” he said.

Technical picture:

Technically, the Nifty50 witnessed a bloodbath on the D-Street yet again after a short-covering session on Friday. There was no follow up buying after the short covering; on the contrary Nifty witnessed fresh round of selling that was so fierce that it pushed the market into a lower circuit.

Experts feel that considering the fact the Nifty50 is trading near crucial support levels a technical bounce back could be seen while some support is placed at 7200 followed by 6800 levels. It is a sell on rallies market, and investors should not go long on a bounce back.

“The sentiments are significantly gloomy on the street. On the way down, the index breached the swing low of 7832 & is approaching 61.8% retracement of the rally post-2011 low, which is near 7550,” Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, Senior Technical Analyst, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas told Moneycontrol.

“On the other hand, any bounce towards 7850-8000 can be taken as a fresh shorting opportunity,” he said.

On the options front, maximum Call OI is placed at 12,000, followed by 10,000 strikes while the maximum Put OI is placed at 8,000 followed by 7,500 strikes.

Despite the measures to curb volatility and short selling taken by the market regulator last week, the Nifty5o index ended the decline with a huge loss of around 13 percent, which is the highest ever daily loss in history.

It formed a bearish candle on the daily chart and made a new 4 years-low. “At the current juncture, the market is in strong bear grip and thus not respecting any support levels,” Chandan Taparia, Vice President, Analyst-Derivatives at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Limited told Moneycontrol.

“As of now, there is no sign of reversal and thus traders should refrain bottom fishing in this market. Going forward, resistance is shifting lower to 8200 - 8500 zone, while the next support is now placed at 7200 and then 6800 zone,” he said.

"March 23, 2020 03:46 PM IST",-2,Tanya Khandelwal,"Currently trading at a price-to-book value of 2.25 times, Nifty not too far away from its bottom","Stocks by their very nature tend to be volatile and the Indian market has seen similar – or worse – crashes in the past, though the triggers were always different.
A common valuation metric, the price-to-book-value says the Nifty, at its cheapest has traded at a price-to-book value of 2.1 times, in May 2003.
With the Nifty currently trading at 2.25 times, this would imply that the index is not too far away from its bottom.
(So if a company with a Rs 100 crore profit as valued at Rs 1,000 crore, the P/E ratio comes to 10.)
The average historical P/E ratio stands at around 16 times.","Nifty, at its cheapest, traded at a price-to-book value of 2.1 times in May 2003.","Indian indices have fallen over 30 percent over the past month, spooked by the alarming spread of the novel coronavirus both globally and locally, and its resultant economic impact.

Stocks by their very nature tend to be volatile and the Indian market has seen similar – or worse – crashes in the past, though the triggers were always different.

If one has to think of parallels to the ongoing market rout, most notably, the crashes of 1992 (the Harshad Mehta scandal), 2000 (dotcom bust) and 2008 (global financial crisis) came to mind.

But if one were to use history as a guide, how bad can a crash get? What are the levels, from a valuation perspective, at which all the bad news is priced into stocks?

A common valuation metric, the price-to-book-value says the Nifty, at its cheapest has traded at a price-to-book value of 2.1 times, in May 2003.

With the Nifty currently trading at 2.25 times, this would imply that the index is not too far away from its bottom.

Assuming a 10 percent fall from current levels would bring the Nifty to 7,900 levels.

Another metric to consider is the market-cap-to-GDP ratio, often prescribed by Warren Buffett as the parameter with which to evaluate stocks.

In 2008, the market bottomed out at a mcap-to-GDP ratio of 53 percent.

With India's FY20 GDP expected to be at Rs 200 lakh crore, and the mcap of Indian stocks currently at Rs 116 lakh crore, the ratio stands at 58 percent.

Were the market to bottom out at mcap-to-GDP ratio of 50 percent, it would mean a correction of another 15 percent from current levels, or a Nifty of 7,200.

Finally, the most common metric that is used to judge stock valuations is the price-to-earnings ratio. It is the multiple of the price investors are willing to pay for a business times its annual profit. (So if a company with a Rs 100 crore profit as valued at Rs 1,000 crore, the P/E ratio comes to 10.)

On aggregate, the large companies in the benchmark indices such as the Sensex or Nifty have been valued at a P/E ratio of anywhere between 12 and 30, depending on the optimism (or pessimism) over future earnings. The average historical P/E ratio stands at around 16 times.

Before the market correction began, the Nifty was trading at a little over 12,000. With the Nifty companies expected to make earnings-per-share of Rs 540 this year (fiscal year 2019-20), the P/E ratio stood at a steep 22 times on a current-year basis.

This ratio has come down to a little over 15 times, slightly below the historical average.

Were the Nifty to come down to a P/E ratio of 12, it would translate to a level of 6,480, which could imply a correction of another 23 percent from current levels, or a total fall of about 50 percent from the peak.

Interestingly, 6,400 is also about the level at which the Nifty peaked out before the 2008 crash and after a rebound in 2010, and is considered sacrosanct by many technical analysts.

These analysts also say that before reaching 6,400, the Nifty could also find some support at 7,200 and 7,900 levels, the February and December 2016 lows.

The bottom line: both on a technical and fundamental basis, 7,900, 7,200 and 6,400 would be the levels where the Nifty could bottom out, if one uses history as a guide.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/currently-trading-at-a-price-to-book-value-of-2-25-times-nifty-not-too-far-away-from-its-bottom-5061711.html

The massacre continued in the week gone by led by the undefined uncountable impact of Covid-19. Indices and stocks hit newer lows and washed out multi-year gains.

A double-digit fall was seen this week as well for both Nifty and Bank Nifty that pushed the indices down in excess of 12 percent and 19 percent respectively.

The participants in a sequence of short and unwinding kept the incremental pessimism coming into the indices' futures with and an addition of over 13 percent in both the futures for the week.

There was a bit of increment in the last session as the indices tried to recover but the reliability is questionable as the underlying issue is far from settling.

On the other hand, the aggregate futures in the penultimate week of March expiry did see the fright creeping in as the tally got reduced by 10 percent for the week.

Almost 56 percent of all the participating stocks lost OI over weakness as the traders distanced themselves from the uncertainly and due to more of a systematic risk that this week brought upon us.

None of the sectors could push themselves into positive territory. Hence, we have either short interest added or long unwounded in all the sectors.

The fear was quite visible in sectors like Metal, Capital Goods, NBFC and Auto as they lost a lot of participation.

The additional interest could be seen in some of the PSUs, Telecom and IT stocks but that too can be attributed to the one-offs in a handful of stocks.

Majority of stocks and sectors unwinding OI indicates withdrawal symptom led by fear of the ongoing in a measurable problem at hand.

On the sentimental front, OIPCR of Nifty still remains fairly above 1. This can be attributed to the very nature of the neutralisation process often times adopted by the writers.

This is because many times when a writer gets stuck on the Put side and the index falls rapidly there is an interest to neutralise the position via an equally effective yet economical set of positions of adding Short Futures and Long Call to cut the Short Put synthetically. This leads to loss of significance in the reading of OIPCR as a sentimental indicator.

On the other hand, the Implied Volatilities (IV) of the week that has gone by can only be compared to the levels that were hit by Nifty in the year 2008.

Extraordinary increment in realized volatility has raised implied volatility levels in options. Due to this, the premiums have skyrocketed and the bid-ask spreads have widened beyond imagination.

Set-ups like these make trading in options unattractive due to the reduced liquidity and reduced RoI (since options are expensive). On the other hand, trading futures do not make sense due to the very risk of the ongoing volatility.

Empirically such periods have ended in prolonged calmer times. Till such signs come into trade analytics with a drop in Implied Volatility, it would be wise to await an opportunity instead of venturing into a trade.

PVR: Buy | Target: Rs 1,800 | Return: 37 percentWe upgraded PVR to buy from reduce with FV of Rs 1,800 (Rs 1,850) valuing it at 11X FY2022E EV/EBITDA (unchanged).
Sobha: Buy | Target: Rs 465 | Return: 157 percentWe upgraded Sobha to buy (from add) with a revised fair value estimate of Rs 465share (from Rs 515/share).","Given the sharp fall in stock prices across sectors, most experts advised accumulating quality and fundamentally strong scrips with a long term perspective.","The market has plunged nearly 28 percent in the last month. Investors worried the most about the global growth after the wide-spreading Covid-19 or novel coronavirus.

FIIs also sold more than $8 billion worth of shares in almost a month, followed by heavy short selling, which dragged most of the stocks to multi-year or record lows.

With the number of infected cases from the virus and the death toll on the rise, many countries in the world, including India, have gone into lockdown. This is expected to have a negative impact on the earning of companies and also the global economy.

""The sharp correction in the stock prices of most largecap and midcap stocks suggest that the market expects sharply lower earnings (to the extent of 20-50 percent) of companies in perpetuity because of the Covid-19 situation,"" Kotak Institutional Equities said.

""As several events in the past have shown, the world will eventually recover from the aftermath of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; the pain will be extreme for affected countries and households but hopefully short-lived for most companies and individuals,"" said the brokerage.

Given the sharp fall in stock prices across sectors, most experts advised accumulating quality and fundamentally strong scrips with a long-term perspective as valuations turned more attractive than earlier.

Moneycontrol has collated a list of 14 stocks that were upgraded to buy by Kotak Institutional Equities. These stocks could give return in the range of 10-157 percent in next one year:

Hindustan Unilever: Buy | Target: Rs 2,250 | Return: 10 percent

Even as we do not rule out some short-term pressure on topline growth on account of the immediate and derivative impacts of COVID-19, we see little risk to the key long-term earnings growth drivers – margin expansion, portfolio premiumization, GSK Consumer Healthcare merger, and sublime execution.

In fact, raw material tailwinds have become stronger with the sharp correction in crude. We upgraded the stock to buy (from reduce) with a revised fair value of Rs 2,250/share (from Rs 1,900).

We have moved the valuation approach to an HUL + GSK Consumer Healthcare combined DCF from HUL DCF plus value creation from the acquisition approach earlier.

Infosys: Buy | Target: Rs 680 | Return: 16 percent

We cut FY2021-22E revenue by 5-7 percent and EPS by 10-11 percent as we build the impact of Covid-19 pandemic globally. We forecast revenue decline of 0.9 percent in FY2021E and expect EBIT margin to decline to 20.6 percent. We expect normalization of growth in FY2022E. Post 32 percent correction in stock price, Infosys trades at trough multiple.

We upgraded to buy from add on – (1) attractive valuations; we valued Infosys at a normalized multiple of 16X FY2022E earnings resulting in fair value of Rs 680 (Rs 810 earlier) and (2) wallet share gains and excellence in execution will ensure that it remains in the top percentile on growth.

Bharti Infratel: Buy | Target: Rs 185 | Return: 23.5 percent

The sharp recent correction has brought down Bharti Infratel's EV to 3.9X 3QFY20 annualized EBITDA. Even as we appreciate the sharp, immediate risk to this EBITDA from further consolidation in the wireless market, we believe some of the EBITDA lost will be recouped on the back of (1) higher tenancies from the surviving operators and (2) higher rental/tenant driven by the sliding rental structure.

We turned positive on the stock after a long time. We upgraded to buy (from reduce) with a revised face value of Rs 185/share. Our revised face value reflects a 2+1 wireless market structure.

Apollo Hospitals: Buy | Target: Rs 1,820 | Return: 33.4 percent

We expect Apollo Hospitals to benefit from an improving maturity profile, even as the near-term outlook is challenging given lower volume of international and domestic travel patients, as well as deferment

in OPD footfalls and elective surgeries, though, we expect a full demand recovery in 2HFY21. We cut FY2020/21 estimates, and upgrade to buy with revised fair value of Rs 1,820/share (versus Rs 1,840/share).

Endurance Technologies: Buy | Target: Rs 850 | Return: 16.5 percent

Endurance is likely to outperform the automotive industry growth in India led by new order wins in the domestic market. The near-term growth outlook for the auto industry in India and Europe is challenging but we believe Endurance will be the least impacted among Indian suppliers due to the new orders it secured over the past one year.

We have cut earnings estimates to bake in a more cautious outlook on demand, and the fair value cut to Rs 850 (from Rs 960 earlier).

United Spirits: Buy | Target: Rs 660 | Return: 27 percent

We upgraded United Spirits to buy from reduce with fair value of Rs 660. United Spirits has executed well on premiumization and non-COGS cost optimization over the past few years notwithstanding a weak demand environment and raw material headwinds. Even as demand environment remains challenging (especially ST impact of COVID-19), raw material prices have stabilized and valuations have turned attractive. We revised estimates to factor in the ST impact of COVID-19 and fair value to Rs 660 (from Rs 670).

Cummins India: Buy | Target: Rs 520 | Return: 23.5 percent

We upgraded Cummins India to a buy from reduce based on (1) our assessment of earnings downgrade cycle being largely behind us, (2) diversified mix of businesses helping chug through current uncertain times and (3) reasonable valuations at sub-17X trailing earnings. We lowered fair value to Rs 520 from Rs 590 on 11 percent cut in estimates and lower 18X multiple. Prospects from shift of business to Cummins India from China and from revision in domestic emission norms provide defence against unforeseen negatives in base business.

Tata Communications: Buy | Target: Rs 425 | Return: 80 percent

At just over 5X trailing (FY2020E) EV/EBITDA, we see a lot of value in Tata Communications even if there is some short-term business disruption on account of the Covid-19 impact on the global economy. Tata Communications' existing core business should not see much impact, anyway, barring some impact on the business from the media vertical in the short term. New business signing could get delayed on account of travel restrictions but should see quick recovery once things normalize. We cut ST forecasts, lower face value (FV) to Rs 425 (from Rs 500) and upgraded the stock to buy (from add).

PVR: Buy | Target: Rs 1,800 | Return: 37 percent

We upgraded PVR to buy from reduce with FV of Rs 1,800 (Rs 1,850) valuing it at 11X FY2022E EV/EBITDA (unchanged). While COVID-19 would significantly impact the business in the short term (say two months), we expect it to bounce back thereafter led by pent-up demand and a packed line-up of movies. We cut FY2020-21E EBITDA estimates by 10-23 percent and retain FY2022E estimates. Sharp 40 percent correction from peak presents an opportunity to buy this stock at an attractive valuation.

Just Dial: Buy | Target: Rs 460 | Return: 38 percent

Post the sharp stock price decline, Just Dial stock is available at a deep value. While challenges to the business remain and COVID-19 may result in some loss of business for Just Dial, we believe current risk-reward is extremely favorable (EV/FCF of 1.6X FY2021; market capitalisation of Rs 2,020 crore, cash on books was Rs 1,540 crore as of December 2019). We thus upgraded the stock to buy from reduce with a revised FV of Rs 460 (Rs 570 earlier).

Sobha: Buy | Target: Rs 465 | Return: 157 percent

We upgraded Sobha to buy (from add) with a revised fair value estimate of Rs 465share (from Rs 515/share). The stock has corrected sharply over the past month, allowing a sharp upside to revised fair value estimate, and trading at 0.8X P/B on FY2022E. The current market price gives near no credit to the land bank of Rs 2,600 crore that has traditionally been an area of debate for investors.

Concerns on promoter liquidity constraints are overplayed and should be seen in the context of the purchase of stock by key management personnel over the past month.

Bajaj Auto: Buy | Target: Rs 3,100 | Return: 37.7 percent

We upgraded the stock to buy (from reduce earlier) as valuations (at 11.5X on FY2022E core EPS) turn attractive given strong growth prospects in export markets. The domestic motorcycle segment forms only 10 percent of Bajaj Auto's EBITDA; hence impact on Bajaj Auto will be limited due to BS-VI transition. Export volume growth is strong currently and we built sufficient cushion in our numbers if oil prices remain depressed in the near term. FV revised to Rs 3,100 (from Rs 3,150).

Lupin: Buy | Target: Rs 840 | Return: 31 percent

The recent share price correction means that Lupin valuations reflect only domestic segment valuations, implying deep value and market’s disappointments around the regulatory actions against its facilities as well as a lack of cost cuts, and implying no value to the US despite a strong pipeline build-out. However, we expect continued strong performance in India and EMs, and see levers for operating leverage starting with levo ramp from Q1FY21. We upgraded to buy.

Dalmia Bharat: Buy | Target: Rs 1,050 | Return: 105.4 percent

Dalmia is progressing well to reach 37 mtpa capacity by FY2022E and would penetrate deeper into the West and East regions. With access to 20 states, Dalmia is no longer a regional player. Leverage is well controlled despite aggressive growth with net debt/EBITDA peaking at 1.7X in FY2020E. Concerns on the treasury appear overblown; resolution of the mutual fund case and divestment of IEX holding could trigger a re-rating. Valuations have corrected to an attractive 6X EV/EBITDA FY2022E. We upgraded to buy (from add) at an unchanged face value of Rs 1,050.

Edited excerpts:

A) Whatever they do, investors should not go out of all equity funds at these prices. The worst thing that can be done now is to sell at these prices.

Many mutual funds have strong portfolios. A time like this should be utilised to fine-tune the portfolio. Investors should: (1) consult your trusted financial adviser to see which portfolios have stronger companies, (2) spread your overall portfolio into three or four funds that are reasonably different from each other, eg one large-cap, one multi-cap/balanced, one mid-cap and so on, and (3) do the same thing with fixed income funds.

Having a predominance of credit-risk funds or long-duration funds is not advisable.

A) This is one of those times when logical arguments lose their relevance. Just as we saw frenzy on the bullish side (companies without any profits trading at exorbitant valuations), now we are seeing a frenzy on the bearish side (excellent companies with strong balance sheets and fundamentals available at decade-low valuations).

The only things that an investor can do are:

a) Have a reasonable level of diversification between fixed income, equity, and other assets. The extent of this depends upon each individual's needs for liquidity and is to be decided in consultation with a trusted financial adviser.

b) Within the same asset class, we have a mix of different types of funds. A balanced mix of large-cap, multi-cap and midcap products in equity, and a mix of short-term and medium-term debt in fixed income.

c) Have the equivalent of 6 months' monthly income in a liquid/overnight fund.

A) A SIP is done irrespective of the level of the market. The advantage of a SIP is realised only if the investor has remained with the SIP at least for one full market cycle, preferably longer.

During such a sharp market fall, the investor (if fully invested) can make use of the opportunity to dispassionately look at the portfolio, and switch to stronger companies/better fund portfolios in consultation with their financial advisers.

The only thing not to be done under such conditions is to panic and get out of equity. This is not the level at which equity should be exited.

A) It is a combination of ETF redemptions, the unwinding of leveraged positions, and algo-trading. Considering that almost all of the world's markets are behaving alike, any other market can't be called a “safe haven”.

A) It is early to say. However, it is quite evident that there will be significant earnings cut for the next two-three quarters. The stock market has adjusted for that.

A) Yes, the Covid-19 epidemic is indeed nothing like that we have seen before. But over the last two-three decades, we have periodically faced crisis situations of different kinds.

Not all businesses, not all companies are equally affected by a crisis. Some businesses are inherently stronger, with stronger balance sheets and business models.

When a panic attack strikes, the stock prices of such companies also fall sharply. We simply cannot accept the argument that all businesses and all companies would be permanently affected.

The only reason to stay away from equities is when we believe that there is no economic growth for this country. We don't believe that, so there is no reason to disbelieve the equity market.

Of course, we have to be careful about what we buy and at what prices we buy. Let us all ask ourselves. There are stocks of strong businesses that are now available at 30, 40, or 50% cheaper price compared to just a few months ago.

In all other forms of economic activity, a low price for an asset is considered a strong reason to buy. Why should it be any different for the stock market?

Morgan Stanley has already warned of a global recession in 2020 while global rating agencies such as S&P Global and Fitch Ratings reduced their GDP forecast for India for FY21.

Last week, Fitch Ratings slashed its growth forecast for India from 5.6 percent to 5.1 percent for 2020-21, as Covid-19 hit Indian manufacturers after supply chain disruptions in China while Standard and Poor's (S&P) slashed its 2020 growth projection for India from 5.7 percent to 5.2 percent.

Investors have lost around Rs 24 lakh crore so far in the month of March on the BSE. The average market capitalisation of the BSE-listed companies fell from Rs 152.54 lakh crore as on 30th April to Rs 116.09 lakh crore recorded on March 20.

Both Sensex, as well as Nifty50, are now trading below crucial support levels. The S&P BSE Sensex plunged below 30,000 while the Nifty50 broke below 9,000-8,800 in the week gone by.

Amid all the gloom and doom in the market investors should avoid making some basic mistakes which could derail their plan of creating wealth over a period of time. Most of the investor portfolios have gone in the red with drawdowns of more than 20 percent, and in an extreme case, it could be 40-50 percent as well.

But, experts feel that staying put is the only way, and following some basic rules of investing will help them beat the stress of notional value erosion which has happened in their portfolios.

Mistakes are plentiful during a market downtrend. Avoid these common ones, and you will be able to keep your hard-earned cash intact, suggest experts. Here are some of the ruled which one should make note of:

Expert: Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit Financial Services

DON'T SELL QUALITY NAMES:

Spread your investment in time, stocks and sectors. Stick with good stocks having leadership in sector, products or niche segment. Don't be lured by low prices like new low, 52-week low or a bounce in price during such consolidation period.

Capitulation is not an opportunity for all stocks. Stick with quality and check the fundamental, chart and qualitative analysis before investing.

INVEST IN RESILIENT BUSINESSES

If one peeps into the year 2008, markets sharply declined around 50-60% from highs and stock prices of businesses which created wealth like Asian Paints, Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys corrected about 20-25%.

Drawing a similar analogy, given the recent correction, one should plan to invest in resilient businesses that have corrected only around 5-7%. Names like Kotak Mahindra Bank, Asian Paints, Bajaj Finance, Pidilite Industries and HUL giving the benefit of diversification as well and hence should be considered as potential buys.

Expert: Gaurav Garg, Head of Research at CapitalVia Global Research Limited- Investment Advisor

INVEST WITH LONG TERM HORIZON:

Investing should be for the long haul and one should not react based on one day or one-week performance. For instance, between May 2008 and February 2009, the S&P 500 lost nearly half of its value.

In the five years that followed the S&P 500 climbed more than 153 percent. The stock market is hit by a deluge of bad news from both India and globally. Apart from the virus threat, crude prices would set the tone for the market in the near term.

Panicking in such a situation can lead to more wealth erosion or might depreciate your capital.

FOCUS ON PROTECTING CAPITAL:

Investors should focus on protecting capital by avoiding some common mistakes that they usually make in a downtrend market. This would be the right time to invest in most of the stocks which are placed well fundamentally as they are oversold and are available at many attractive valuations.

INVEST IN A STAGGERED MANNER:

Investors should invest in a staggered manner to make the most of this volatility. When the market bottoms out, one should keep investing and not try to time the market. However, we would advise waiting for the market to settle before taking a buy position.

Expert: William O'Neil India

BUYING BEFORE A BASE COMPLETES

During the recent market correction, many stocks pulled down to their respective 200-DMA and only some found support. To some traders, long-term support was a buying opportunity.

The key to making money in the market is waiting until a base completes before buying. In most cases, stocks that come down to their 200-day lines do so amid signs of institutional selling.

Wait for the stock to prove itself more, and look for signs of institutional buying as the stock builds the right side of the base. Then you have a legitimate base.

BUYING EVERY POSSIBLE BREAKOUT:

Bullish stock charts tempt investors all the time during down markets. Some growth names will hang in there with compelling charts. A breakout may work for a while, but it will likely be short-lived. While stocks that hold up the best during down markets can go on to be the next leaders, they still should not be bought during a [downtrend}.

KEEP HOLDING A STOCK OR EVEN AVERAGING DOWN

The stock trades at Rs 100 a share. Your cost basis is Rs 100. The stock heads lower, and you buy an equal amount of shares at Rs 80, lowering your cost basis to Rs 90. Then you add further at Rs 75 after it breaches its 50-and 200-DMA.

The problem is that you're averaging down in a former leader that's under tremendous institutional selling pressure. You will be doing some serious damage to your portfolio. It rarely makes sense to buy a stock that has the potential to spiral lower before finally hitting a bottom.

BUYING LOW P/E STOCKS

The Price-to-earnings ratio is a common valuation tool. But buying/selling decision based on P/E is not a prudent move. Expensive stocks can become cheap, but cheap stocks become cheaper in a down market.

Trying to catch a stock “on-sale” is fraught with risk. In many cases, stocks with low P/E ratios are suffering from weak fundamentals, where shrinking market share results in lower earnings growth. That's not something you want to see in a stock.

Remember, some of the best merchandise in the stock market often sells at a pricey valuation due to strong fundamentals and bullish growth prospects.

STOP PAYING ATTENTION

It is easy to lose interest when stocks are selling off, but market downtrends let high-quality names take a breather and eventually build new bases. When a new uptrend is confirmed, breakouts deliver the biggest gains. During a market pullback, try hard to make a list of stocks that held up the best.

A few will show limited signs of distribution (heavy-volume selling) on the way down and accumulation (high-volume buying) on the way up.

Focus on the most resilient names with the least amount of technical damage. They will generally be your best prospects.

The capital market shutdown has multifold ramifications of what a market shutdown would mean:

Complete loss of reputation and confidence from a global standpoint. Most markets are trading online, including India.

Shutting down India's markets when the rest of the world (including Italy, Spain, etc.) still operate online would mean and send a signal that we can't have minimal BCP as compared to the rest of the world?

Let's take a few examples - What happens to someone who wants to redeem money from a liquid fund or a debt fund or an equity fund to pay for any expenses, hospitalization, or even any living expenses, etc.?

What happens if you shut down the market for 5 days to see it reopen a 20-30% lower gap-down in 5 days? Say the Nifty does open lower, what happens to the systemic risks that get opened up for brokers, clients, clearing corporations, exchanges because of panic in re-opening?

The capital markets historically have been positioned as a promise and symbol of liquidity as compared to real estate, etc. such that in case you need liquidity from on asset in 2 days, the stock markets will be liquid such that you can get money.

What happens to that promise?

Also, God forbid, this blows out of proportion (which I pray it doesn't) then will market be shut for 15, 20, 30, 60 days? Has anyone imagined what would happen in such a case? Also, when do you decide to reopen? When the last patient has recovered?

When there are no new cases? No one knows what's happening and what's going to happen.

In today's world, capital markets almost operate as a proxy to banks and banking services. All settlements, etc are extremely interconnected. Are banks being shut down as well?

If doctors are custodians of people's health, people working in the stock markets are custodians of people's wealth. While wealth may be less important than health, but can't be completely ignored.

While there will be disruptions and customer, the experience would be affected, but definitely not shattered as would happen in a complete market shutdown.

While the argument for a shorter trading day could be made and would be a void, a complete shutdown would be disastrous.

Regulators have looked at curbs to reduce panic and volatility; further steps could be looked at:

• Reduce trading hours from the 10-2 in line with banking settlements• Gradually further increase margins in derivatives and cash segments to make excessive speculation difficult

• For brokers, look at few relaxations on compliances pertaining to filing compliances, reporting compliances, etc. so that fewer people need to work (MCX has done this. Other yet to follow)

COVID-19 has thrown the global market into a frenzy. The domestic market is on a similar trajectory even though India is still at Stage 2 of the novel coronavirus. This is mainly because the D-Street factors in the worst.

Many investors are starting to doubt the wisdom of staying invested after seeing the sharp fall in stock indices in the last one month. Many of them have never been subjected to this kind of volatility in the past.

Something that one experiences only once in 8 or 10 years. And therefore, getting concerned about the safety of their lifetime savings is natural.

Most of the time, such wild swings in the markets are irrational. But they still happen because of the deluge of selling that comes from people gripped by fear.

For instance, in the present situation, there is no doubt that the coronavirus pandemic is spreading very fast and has affected a lot of nations but this is not the first time that the world has faced such pandemics. If at all, the world is more resourceful than ever before to deal with such a serious outbreak

Most countries right now are acting with speed and alacrity. India is no different. We are already seeing the government officials tracking every suspected case.

It is impossible to have timelines in such a global phenomenon, but it would be safe to say that in the next 2-3 months, the spread of the coronavirus should be controlled to a large extent.

This is a fair assumption to make considering that country after country is going into a complete lockdown mode. And once the human contact is curtailed, the spread of infection in the community will nosedive.

Economic activity is bound to slow down globally during such a scenario where people are fearful of even getting out of their homes. The real issue is whether the economic slowdown would be for the next 1-2 quarters or next 1-2 years.

Past experiences of similar viral outbreaks, which were also global, suggest that most of the times the fears were unfounded, and the containment happened in a matter of few months.

Coming back to the stock markets, the moment market participants realise that the normalcy is about to return in the world, the markets would go in a reverse direction with the same speed at which they have now corrected.

Here is a chart that depicts the gyrations of Sensex in the past 20 years. Look at the number of negative events that it witnessed.

"March 21, 2020 12:39 PM IST",-1,Kshitij Anand,Higher implied volatility amid COVID-19 fear: Use these 3 modifications while ‘writing' trades,"This makes Option Writing a lot riskier.
Stop that immediately when implied volatility is as high as it is right now.
Trade the drops in implied volatility instead of time as in current situation change in implied volatility would impact the premiums more than time.
Fortunately, if we see the implied volatility on its way down.
In a nutshell, what we have discussed are a few techniques that puts implied volatility in the front seat and being vigilant about the drawdowns more important.","Writing Options and covering the Option Buyer is equally difficult as the possibility of any unforeseen, unexpected rises a lot. This makes the Option Writing a lot riskier.","Shubham Agarwal

Options have been compared with insurance policies a lot of times and right so as the instrument has many comparable qualities. Taking this analogy, a bit forward writing or selling Options is similar to selling an insurance policy.

With the receipt of premium, an option writer just like an insurance policy assures the buyer of the policy to pay-up in the case an unforeseen event.

More often than not the unforeseen or unexpected does not happen and the writer pockets the premium. But, sometimes similar to the current situation with the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, these insurance policy writers are in tough times.

Writing Options and covering the Option Buyer is equally difficult as the possibility of any unforeseen, unexpected event increases. This makes Option Writing a lot riskier.

Just like in 2008, nobody knows when this pandemic will end and there is even less accountable and forecastable in terms of the damage it could do.

In situations like this, liquidity dries up. While premiums are more attractive than ever no one wants to write due to the sheer rise in the probability of loss.

As a result, these three trade modifications could come in to play by option writers.

Reworking the frequency of writing:

The best practice is to reduce the systematic writing practice. More often than not Option writers are used to calendar-based Writing. This means some of them would open short option positions right at the beginning of the month, some five days before and so forth.

Stop that immediately when implied volatility is as high as it is right now. Trade the drops in implied volatility instead of time as in current situation change in implied volatility would impact the premiums more than time.

Resorting to Re-Insurance:

So, the one thing that comes to rescue is the real-world scenario - Re-Insurance. Write Options but with a Known loss meaning Sell an Option but at the same time Buy a farther strike Option at the same time and Sell an Insurance and Buy one as well. Sell a Put and Buy a lower Put or other way around in Calls.

Butterflies:

This would come at a later stage but since we are already a couple of weeks in the turmoil. Fortunately, if we see the implied volatility on its way down.

Use butterfly to gain a maximum of the time value. Sell both Call and Put of the strikes closest to the current underlying level and buy strikes on either side with a distance equal to the premium received.

Example: if we see risk reduction after a spike around 9,800 Sell 10,000 Call & Put. Let us say if we pocket Rs 600 Buy 9,400 Put and 10,600 Call.

But, before using this modification to the Option Writing remember is someone finds the vaccine for COVID-19 we may just reverse in full swing instead of just halting the fall and consolidating.

In a nutshell, what we have discussed are a few techniques that puts implied volatility in the front seat and being vigilant about the drawdowns more important.

Both Sensex and Nifty50 plunged to a fresh 3-year low breaking crucial support levels on the way down. The S&P BSE Sensex broke below 30,000 while Nifty50 breached 9000 levels.

But, have we reached a ‘Dooms Day' scenario considering the fact the global cases of Coronavirus have crossed 200,000? Well, maybe not, but the pain is likely to remain for some more time, says Prateek Pant, Co-Founder & Head of Products & Solutions, Sanctum Wealth Management Private Limited said who has over 2 decades of experience in a ‘Market Podcast' with Moneycontrol.

“We are in abnormal times, and I don't think most of us have not seen this before as well. In my 25 years of experience – I have seen Harshat Mehta or the DotCom bubble, but the type of drawdowns which the market has seen in a short period of time is unprecedented,” he said in the podcast.

The current crisis is a confluence of three factors, explains Pant. Global equity markets including India, have taken further deep cuts in the week gone by as a confluence of factors play out – Crude oil price war, the spread of coronavirus and domestically the Yes Bank cookie crumbling.

Earnings will suffer is because there is complete lockdown across the world, economic activity has come to a standstill and many businesses are completely scared and impacted by this.

What should investors do now?

Considering the fact that people are sitting on massive losses across their portfolio be it mutual funds or equity portfolio, investors should not panic and discontinue SIP or systematic investment plans.

Historically, it is seen that equity as an asset class delivers or outperform over a period of time. Yes, we are seeing massive volatility at this point of time. “Avoid looking at your portfolio on a daily basis especially if it is a long term,” explains Pant.

Investors should stay composed and there is a possibility that investors' goal might also shift amid the recent selloff we have seen in the markets. But, the most important thing to focus on is asset allocation and move some money from debt portfolio to equities in a staggered way.

Why asset allocation is important because a massive amount of liquidity is going to come into equity markets, and Mr. Market usually discounts everything well in advance.

Pant further added that if investors don't get into equity markets on time they will miss the bus because markets usually discount future events well in advance. A lot of great businesses are available at attractive valuation be in financials, consumption or pharma.

The valuations are looking attractive and this is once in a lifetime opportunity for investors because these are the valuations that were seen 8-10 years back.

Covid-19, which originated in China's Wuhan, has now spread to over 70 countries and has been declared a pandemic by WHO.

Nifty, Sensex have fallen around 30 percent each and many stocks are trading at their multi-year lows.

ICICI Direct has envisaged the impact of coronavirus (COVID-19) on its midcap coverage universe based on the revenue contribution from both the US as well as Europe.

Since the brokerage believes these two geographies are witnessing an upsurge in patients infected by coronavirus, there is a high probability of city lockdowns in the near future as witnessed in a few European countries recently.

""We expect this to largely hamper manufacturing growth compared to the services sector, going ahead.""

In its midcap universe of 11 companies, the research house expects Tata Chemicals, VA Tech Wabag, Emmbi Industries and Kanpur Plastipack to be the most affected stocks given that all these have revenue contributions in excess of 30-35 percent each from the said geographies.

""The rest, from our universe, could be affected by supply chain issues related to raw material, which, we believe, is largely discounted in the stock price,"" it said.

In terms of raw material requirements, the majority of the chemical inputs are imported from China.

""With China returning to action recently albeit, at lower utilisation, we do not expect much impact from the supply side. However, the real impact can come from the demand side due to the cascading impact of the slowdown. This can eventually lead to suppressed prices and, thereby, financial growth of most companies,"" ICICI Direct said.

""Further, a cash flow crunch can impact the debt repayment schedule. However, we expect the same to be refinanced largely as most economies are coming out with quantitative easing (QE) leading to lower interest rates,"" it added.

However, the brokerage expects companies with a high levered balance sheet or low cash flows to face challenges to refinance. Thus, it believes one should select strong balance sheet companies with low leverage and higher cash flows during these turbulent times.

It further believes the majority of the negative outcomes from COVID-19, for at least the next two quarters, have already been discounted across global indices.

""However, either any delay beyond that or a substantial increase in infection can result in more negative outcomes. Hence, the probability of a further downside in equity indices cannot be ruled out.""

However, ICICI Direct believes a majority of the stocks are available at suppressed valuations; therefore, this is the right time to build a portfolio in a gradual manner to gain from the roller coaster ride ahead.

Here are top five midcap picks from the brokerage in this falling market:

Indian markets have not been left undamaged from the coronavirus pandemic. We saw a sharp fall in the last week whereby Nifty traded below the 8,000-mark almost after 4 years and touched 7,832-levels on the downside.

The index managed to take support from the demand zone standing around 7,800-8,000 levels on a quarterly time frame. At the same time, Nifty has temporarily halted its down move by closing above crucial resistance of 8,600.

Moreover, short-term trend reversal confirmation will arrive on a daily close above 9,150 levels which is the highest high mark of the last three days' candle. Conservatively, relief rally towards unfilled gap territory (9,600) cannot be ruled out.

The index has given a fall of 4,000 points in the last three weeks which has put the majority of the oscillators in the oversold zone, monthly Commodity Channel Index (CCI) is standing at -289 which is below oversold levels of -200 which indicates highly oversold markets and daily CCI is placed around -112 with positive divergence implying short term price reversal in process.

Additionally, the stochastic oscillator is showing a positive divergence on the daily time frame which has also accelerated the confidence in the price reversal.

Furthermore, 5 weeks EMA is trading around 10,200 and as long as Nifty is trading below these levels, one should trade with sell-on-rise strategy. Nonetheless, a decisive close below strong demand zone of 7,800 can push the index towards the line of parity on the monthly time frame standing around 7,300 marks.

Banking Index continued to extend its losing streak for the sixth week as an intensified sell-off throughout the week was seen. However, relief rally on the last trading session pushed it above crucial psychological levels of 20,000.

As a majority of the oscillators are in the oversold zone, one relief rally towards 25,000 levels cannot be ruled out. Conversely, the confirmation of short-term reversal will be seen on a daily close above 22,500.

Below are the 3 stocks that can return 11-21%

The India Cements: Buy above Rs 102 | Target: Rs 124 | Stop Loss: Rs 88 | Upside: 21%

The stock has formed a Double-Bottom on the weekly chart and is on the verge of breaking the downward sloping trend line. The momentum indicator MACD has crossed the signal line indicating a start of a trend. The RSI too is above its key 50-mark indicating positive momentum on its side.

It was until recently undergoing a larger time frame consolidation which we think was a pause in the larger trend. Overall breakout is expected to come above 102 levels for further strong bullish momentum. We recommend a buy above 102 keeping a stop loss of 88 for the target of 124.

Bharti Airtel: Buy around Rs 420-430 | Target: Rs 500 | Stop Loss: Rs 380 | Upside 16%

After hitting the peak of Rs 550, the stock slipped lower till Rs 380 from where the chances of developing demand are higher. It has been trading in a range-bound zone of Rs 550 and Rs 375 mark. Currently, the stock is trading near its multi-support horizontal line and the point of polarity on the daily chart is giving cues to accumulate this stock at lower levels.

Positive divergence in MACD on the daily chart suggests upside momentum. As long as it sustains above Rs 400, the possibility of moving on the upside is higher and it can hit our first target of Rs 500. We recommend buying Bharti Airtel around Rs 425 with a stop loss of Rs 380 for the target of Rs 500 levels.

Hindustan Unilever: Buy around Rs 1975-1990 | Target: Rs 2208 | Stop Loss: Rs 1825 | Upside 11%

The occurrence of bullish engulfing at bottom levels showing an upsurge move on the higher side. RSI took a flip on the positive side from its oversold levels creates positive sentiment. Moreover, the declining histogram of MACD also looking conducive for the scrip. Furthermore, strong support is seen near 1900 levels where 200 DMA is seen.

Breakout is expected to come above Rs 2060 from where buying momentum in the stock will increase in the coming sessions. By looking at all these mentioned factors, we recommend buying HUL around Rs 1975-1990 for the target of Rs 2200 and Rs 2250 with a stop loss of Rs 1,825-mark on closing basis.

"March 23, 2020 08:42 AM IST",-1,Kshitij Anand,Nine stocks listed for F&O ban on March 23; what does SEBI circular mean for markets?,"The move is aimed at reducing the volatility in the market as it could curb short-selling both in the F&O as well as the cash segment.
The regulator also introduced margins in the cash market on stocks that are part of the F&O list and even on stocks that are not part of the list.
""SEBI's new norms are expected to be a market confidence-boosting factor and are aimed at reducing the extreme volatility seen in F&O stocks.
Restricting fresh short positions against the underlying security will curb fresh naked short positions in the market.
Effectively about 10-12% of the F&O stocks would see an impact.","Effectively about 10-12% of the F&O stocks would be impacted. For most other stocks, even if MWPL are restricted, open interest is far lower to have any meaningful impact.","The Nifty50 closed the week ended March 20 with losses of over 12 percent, while a bigger carnage was seen in the broader market space.

Tracking the volatility in the market, which has so far eroded more than Rs 20 lakh crore in terms of market capitalisation on the BSE, SEBI introduced a few measures to curb volatility.

India's volatility index (India VIX) shot up to levels that were last seen during the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis — closing at 67.10 on Friday.

NSE has placed 9 securities in the F&O ban period — JSPL, NCC, Adani Enterprises, PVR, Vodafone Idea, JustDial, PNB, Indiabulls Housing Finance, and Yes Bank.

Short-selling in these stocks in the ban period will become slightly difficult.

The move is aimed at reducing the volatility in the market as it could curb short-selling both in the F&O as well as the cash segment.

Short-selling is a practice where traders/investors sell stocks in the hope of buying it at a lower price.

SEBI restricted the extent of short-selling of index derivatives by mutual funds, foreign portfolio investors and proprietary traders. The regulator also introduced margins in the cash market on stocks that are part of the F&O list and even on stocks that are not part of the list.

According to a SEBI circular, short-selling is the sale of a security that the seller does not own. The votaries of short-selling consider it as a desirable and an essential feature of a securities market.

The critics of short selling, on the other hand, are convinced that it, directly or indirectly, poses potential risks and can easily destabilise the market.

""SEBI's new norms are expected to be a market confidence-boosting factor and are aimed at reducing the extreme volatility seen in F&O stocks. This will impact the speculators and could lead to some short covering on Monday,” Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told Moneycontrol.

“For the long term, markets will continue to focus on whether virus infection rates peak out and also on the coordinated actions of RBI and the government to support businesses with relief package,” he said.

In the recent past, global markets have also taken similar measures to curb short selling, while some of them have closed the exchanges (Philippines stock exchange).

Markets across the world have been under pressure as infected cases of Coronavirus exceeded 300,000 globally. In India, many parts of the country are facing a lockdown, a situation which is similar to other nations such as USA, Iran, and Italy.

A lockdown threatens the economic activity of a country; hence, fears of a possible recession has gripped markets. Hence, panic selling is seen in equity markets across the globe. FIIs have pulled out more than Rs 50,000 cr so far from the cash segment of Indian equity markets.

In order to curb the extreme volatility witnessed in the stock market, SEBI has introduced measures such as revising the market-wide position limit to 50 percent which will reduce fresh short positions in individual stocks.

In simple words, no fresh positions will be allowed in the underlying security, once the 50 percent criterion is met. An increase in margin for the cash segment to 40 percent will lead to a higher margin requirement for intraday positions.

Restricting fresh short positions against the underlying security will curb fresh naked short positions in the market. And, restricting long positions only to the tune of available cash and equivalents will reduce the overall speculation in the equity market, suggest experts.

“When other economies are resorting to banning short selling on account of increased volatility, such a move by SEBI should provide some relief on the overall volatility witnessed in the markets and should calm in the markets in the short term,” Vijay Kuppa, Co-Founder, Orowealth said.

Jimeet Modi, Founder & CEO, Samco Securities is of the view that these are good steps to reduce excessive volatility. The market-wise limits have been reduced which means more stocks likely to go into F&O trading ban period.

“Also there is a practical short-selling cap at 500 crores that's been levied. If someone wants to speculate beyond prescribed limits of 500 crores, they will need to put up twice the margin which will be blocked for 3 months,” he said.

Modi further added that the impact of this circular would be highest on stocks with the very high volatility that include names like NCC, Jindal Steel & Power, Indiabulls Housing, Canara Bank, Adani Enterprises, Canara Bank, PNB, SAIL, PVR, Vodafone Idea, Just Dial and YES Bank.

Effectively about 10-12% of the F&O stocks would see an impact. For most other stocks, even if MWPL is restricted, open interest is far lower to have any meaningful impact.

Stocks such as IndusInd Bank, Bandhan Bank, IDFC First Bank, RBL Bank, and Federal Bank have been among the top losers in the Nifty Bank index since Feb 1.
""A part of it can be assigned to the uncertainties regarding Yes Bank and the issues this has thrown up.

Nifty Bank index has corrected nearly 35 percent since February 1, after the market started falling in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.

In the index, stocks have fallen up to 60 percent since then and it looks difficult to say how they are going to fare in the near term.

Stocks such as IndusInd Bank, Bandhan Bank, IDFC First Bank, RBL Bank, and Federal Bank have been among the top losers in the Nifty Bank index since Feb 1.

Even as top brokerages and financial firms such as Morgan Stanley believe large private banks, including ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank, are better placed, given their market share gains, they also underscore that the near-term volatility may be high.

While the fears over rising cases of coronavirus and its impact on the economy triggered an all-round selling, investors also turned anxious after the Yes Bank was put on moratorium by the Reserve Bank of India and the Supreme Court refused to offer any relief to the telecom firms.

""A part of it can be assigned to the uncertainties regarding Yes Bank and the issues this has thrown up. Banking stocks have corrected sharply because of 2 things. One is the Covid-19 impact which has affected the market generally, the other is the uncertainty caused by the worry of an increase in stressed assets of banks. With the supreme court not providing any respite to telecom players, the banking stocks which have exposure to the telecom sector were also impacted,"" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.

The risk of bad loans has increased for banks in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak and the road looks bumpy for them.

""A prolonged slowdown in the economy can affect the businesses leading to an impact on earnings. Since the virus spread can be contained only with limited interactions, consumption demand will definitely get affected. This does raise the risk and already over-leveraged firms will be affected, raising the risk of bad loans,"" Nair said.

Then, the way forward is to look at the large private banks that have a strong market presence. HDFC Bank, State Bank of India and Kotak Mahindra Bank are some names, Nair suggests.

Global brokerage firm Credit Suisse is of the view that after the Yes Bank bailout, the market is concerned about the deposits.

As per Credit Suisse, IndusInd Bank and RBL Bank have reported a 2-3 percent decline in deposits in recent weeks even though liquidity at both banks appears to be adequate.

Credit Suisse warns that liquidity constraints will aggravate the credit crunch in the economy whereas asset quality outlook becomes more uncertain, given the economic disruption.

The global brokerage said larger private banks are well capitalised and competitively well-positioned and HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank remain its top picks.

Four takeaways from UBS' HDFC Bank conference call:Impact on asset quality and growthTrends in unsecured retail asset quality are stable and 80 percent of the unsecured loans are to salaried employees.
While some states directed their departments to keep deposits with PSU banks, recent RBI advisory should offset any impact, UBS said.
UBS believes a sustained economic slowdown could impact the banking and finance sector, including HDFC Bank, on several fronts.
""We value HDFC Bank using a sum-of-the-parts analysis,"" UBS said.","UBS does not expect any significant impact on the asset quality, says the trends in the unsecured retail asset quality of the bank are stable.","Brokerage firm UBS on March 20 maintained a “buy” call on HDFC Bank with a target price at Rs 1,480, a 65 percent upside from the previous day's close of the stock at Rs 895.55.

The brokerage does not expect any significant impact on the bank's asset quality and says the trends are stable.

The outbreak of coronavirus has caused serious disruption in the market and the economy. Some brokerages say India's banking sector is staring at a renewed liquidity crisis. HDFC Bank, too, will face some challenges.

Four takeaways from UBS' HDFC Bank conference call:

Impact on asset quality and growth

Trends in unsecured retail asset quality are stable and 80 percent of the unsecured loans are to salaried employees. This majorly comprises good and strong corporates and government employees. Repayments continued to remain healthy, UBS said.

Moreover, the SME portfolio of the bank is well-diversified-- geographically and industry-wise--and UBS does not expect any significant impact on the asset quality.

As much as 70-75 percent of SME loans were secured, UBS said, adding that the bank also had accounts of promoters, employees, which helped in tracking the health of SMEs.

The bank had low exposure to airlines and limited exposure to restaurants and hospitality business but it was too early to comment on, UBS said.

Credit-card spend remained healthy in Jan- Feb 2020 but reduced in March. The management was tightening the underwriting standards for the bank.

""People have shifted to online spending and food delivery and online spending has increased. But in case of a complete lockdown, management expects a decline in customer spending,"" UBS said.

Govt moves in to check coronavirus impact

UBS said the government had taken steps to curb the spread much faster than other countries.

""Though exports will slow down, it is a relatively smaller portion of India's GDP (around 20 percent). Declining oil prices likely partly offset the adverse impact on the economy,"" UBS said.

The bank, as of now, wasn't expecting a countrywide lockdown and the management was taking steps to minimise the impact of the outbreak on branches, UBS said.

Interest rates and deposits

The bank was expecting 50 bps rate cut in the next two quarters, as per the brokerage. The bank recently reduced FD rates but not the savings interest rates.

The ALM committee is likely to take a call on it. While some states directed their departments to keep deposits with PSU banks, recent RBI advisory should offset any impact, UBS said.

Valuation

UBS maintained its earnings estimates currently. ""Our target price is based on SOTP which values core banking business at Rs 1,355 (3.8 times FY21E) and value of subs at Rs 125 per share,"" UBS said.

UBS believes a sustained economic slowdown could impact the banking and finance sector, including HDFC Bank, on several fronts. It will result in a slowdown in credit, increase NPL risk, impact fee income and exert pressure on NIM.

""We value HDFC Bank using a sum-of-the-parts analysis,"" UBS said.

Ltd, said in an interview with Moneycontrol's Kshitij Anand.

A) These are indeed unprecedented times, and it's important to maintain the asset allocation discipline. Given that valuations are attractive, we would recommend investors should capitalise on the same by increasing allocation.

However, the discipline of asset allocation should be maintained given that coronavirus is an evolving situation.

While a large part of the risk is built-in current valuation, a timely resolution of the crisis is important to prevent second-order impact on demand and supply chain.

Overall, we would recommend investors look at equities and allocate capital, which is not required for the next 3 years.

Existing investors should not look at point-to-point returns – most of the losses are quotation and will be recouped over time.

A) The reaction of oil is not linked to equities. It's linked to the OPEC decision to increase production and it has reset the oil prices lower, and that is positive for India. With our current average Brent price forecast of USD 30/bbl, gain to India is in excess of INR 2.5 trillion (~ 1% of GDP). The gain from low oil prices can be shared between central, state govt and the consumers.

A) For large allocations, we would recommend investing about 50 percent lump sum, and remaining can be spread over the next few weeks. For others, SIPs are the most efficient way of capturing the volatility/downside.

A) FPIs have sold equities worth $4.5bn and bond outflows exceed $4bn. The systematic outflow from equities as an asset class via the ETF route is negative for all EMs including India flows.

An important related point is that India has currently huge USD 487bn FX reserves, which will help mitigate the impact on currency owing to FII flows.

A) It's an evolving situation and thus it's not possible to view the impact on earnings for the next two quarters. It is important to look at Covid-19 as a one-off event and thus P/BV would be a better measure for valuation, rather than P/E on immediate earnings.

A) An important point in the equity markets is that generally myopic nature of markets – stock price – reacts more than required to driven by short-term events (i.e. coronavirus); whereas the 'value' which is driven by long-term assumptions like DCF does not change that dramatically.

It will be a fair assumption that the disruption from Covid-19 will be short term, and this issue will be not there, say, one year down the line.

A) We continue to follow a two-pronged approach – a sort of barbell strategy – with significant portion into high-quality names which have now corrected, and at the same time participating in 'deep in value' businesses. Weightage in select public sector companies have been increased.

The BSE Sensex plunged 3,934.72 points or 13.15 percent to close at 25,981.24, while the Nifty50 plunged 1,135.20 points or 12.98 percent to 7,610.25.

Selling pressure was seen acros sectors including banks, Energy, FMCG, Healthcare, IT, Auto, Capital Goods, Consumer Durables, Metal, Oil & Gas, Realty.

The Indian rupee breached 76 against the US dollar for first time, closing 108 paise down at 76.27 a dollar on account of steep fall in equity and FII selling.

The Nifty50 closed the week ended March 20 with losses of over 12 percent while the bigger carnage was seen in the broader market space.

Tracking the volatility in the market which has so far eroded more than Rs 60 lakh crore in terms of market capitalisation on the BSE in the last one month, Sebi introduced a certain measure to curb volatility.

In order to curb the extreme volatility witnessed in the stock market, SEBI has introduced measures such as revising the market-wide position limit to 50 percent which will reduce fresh short positions in individual stocks.

""Tightening rules on short selling can bring down the excessive volatility during times of crisis like this. Therefore, it is to be welcomed. However, there can be unintended consequences during panics,” Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services told Moneycontrol.

“The market is now oversold. The short-covering may lead to sharp volatility. Also, when liquidity is low, selling in the cash market can lead to a crash in prices,” he said.

Here is a list of top five factors which could be weighing on markets:

Global stocks crumble:

Asian shares tumbled as a rising tide of national lockdowns threatened to overwhelm policymakers' frantic efforts to cushion what is likely to be a deep global recession, said a Reuters report.

China's Shanghai Composite, Hong Kong's Hang Seng, Australia's ASX 200 and South Korea's Kospi closed lower by 3-6 percent.

Partisan battles block US Senate coronavirus bill:

Partisan battles in the U.S. Senate on Sunday stopped a coronavirus response bill from advancing, even as negotiations continued over Democrats' demands for more federal funding for medical care and state and local efforts to combat the outbreak, said a Reuters report.

The measure faltered after it failed to get the necessary 60 votes in the 100-member chamber to clear a procedural hurdle after days of negotiations, it said. The failure of the measure to move forward sends Democrats and Republicans back to the bargaining table.

Rise in Coronavirus cases:

The global death toll exceeded over 13,000 with around 300,000 infected cases. Nearly one in three Americans were ordered to stay home on Sunday to slow the spread of the disease, while Italy banned internal travel as deaths there reached 5,476, said a Reuters report.

In India alone, Coronavirus cases jumped over 300 forcing the centre and state governments on March 22 to announce a complete shutdown of 75 districts across the country where COVID-19 cases have been reported.

All inter-state buses, passenger trains, and metro services have been suspended across the country till March 31.

Automakers halt production:

India's biggest automaker Maruti Suzuki India and peers including Mahindra & Mahindra, Mercedes-Benz, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) as well as Hyundai Motor Co said they will halt car production in the country due to the coronavirus outbreak, said a Reuters report.

The move comes after automakers shut plants last week in Europe, the United States, Canada, and Mexico as the global death toll from coronavirus exceeded 13,000, the report added.

FII selling continues:

FIIs net sold Rs 20,908 crore worth of shares in the week ended March 20, taking the total to Rs 51,243 crore in March so far. It was the biggest ever monthly outflow.

They also pulled out more than Rs 52,000 crore from the debt market in the month so far. As a net, they withdrew more than Rs 1.03 crore from India, said a Moneycontrol report.

FIIs have consistently been net sellers to the tune of Rs 62,611.82 crore from February 24, which was over USD 8 billion in dollar terms (at 75.20 per dollar rate).

Tracking global selloff, investors' loses more than Rs 13 lakh crore in a week. The average market capitalisation of the BSE-listed companies fell from Rs 129.26 lakh crore registered on March 13, to Rs 116.09 lakh crore as on March 20.

The Nifty50 broke below crucial support levels as foreign institutional investors I(FIIs) pull out more than Rs 50,000 crore from the cash segment of Indian equity markets, provisional data showed.

""Investors have been liquidating in favour of holding cash, with asset classes from Gold to Government bonds getting affected. FIIs have also contributed to the downtrend in Indian markets, turning net sellers to the tune of around Rs 48,000 crore in March till date,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services told Moneycontrol.

""The unabated spread of COVID-19 and the extent of its impact continue to worry investors. The fear of a global recession turned into reality after rating agencies forecasted much lower global growth rate,"" he said.

Note: Here is a list of top 50 companies out of 300 which have fallen 10-50 percent in a week

Markets across the globe witnessed massive selling which was largely triggered by the fear of a possible recession as highlighted by Morgan Stanley and other international organisation as a rising spread of COVID-19 cases across the world threaten to slow down economic activity.

Although major central banks around the world have announced several measures to cushion the economic impact of COVID-19 in their countries, ranging from rate cuts to liquidity boosters to cash in hand proposals, which so far have not been enough to calm the markets. Investors look for a cure that could help calm investors' nerves.

Consolidation ahead?

Looking at the relentless fall in the equity markets, investors are looking for signs of consolidation. A steady rise on March 20 and steps taken by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to curb volatility are in the right direction which could curb volatility, say experts.

""When other economies resorting to ban on short sell on account of increased volatility, such a move by SEBI should provide some relief on the overall volatility witnessed in the markets and should calm in the markets in the short term,"" Vijay Kuppa, Co-Founder, Orowealth told Moneycontrol.

The Nifty50 rallied nearly 500 points to close above 8,700 on March 20 while the S&P BSE Sensex rose more than 1,600 points. But, both benchmark indices hit a fresh three-year low in the week gone by.

With F&O expiry due on March 26, the market is likely to remain volatile, and big short-covering rally is expected due to SEBI move, suggest experts.

Dipan Mehta at Elixir Equities also told CNBC-TV18, ""It was a global practice; the SEBI has now taken this decision to control the fall in F&O as well as F&O stocks.""

""Short covering is certainly possible in several stocks, but the market will react to global cues; how Europe and the US close on March 20, and how Asian markets and SGX Nifty behave on March 23 along with fundamentals,"" he said.

Tracking selloff in global equities, both Sensex and Nifty witnessed selling pressure on every rise or a pullback rally, and the rally on March 20 suggests that we could be entering some consolidation but, have hit a bottom? Maybe not.

""Sensex and Nifty witnessed sharp cuts in the week gone by. It was a global phenomenon that was visible across the developed and the emerging markets. Nevertheless, a bottom is not in sight yet,"" Gaurav Ratnaparkhi, Senior Technical Analyst, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas told Moneycontrol.

""What we can expect is a consolidation before the markets stretch further on the downside. However considering the magnitude of the fall the consolidation itself can be significantly broad,"" he added.

In the case of Nifty, 8,000-7,800 is a crucial support zone, which is near 78.6 percent retracement of the rally post 2016 low. ""Over there the index has entered a short term consolidation mode that was needed to relieve pressure from the deeply oversold short term momentum indicators,"" said Ratnaparkhi.

He further added that on the higher side, ""9,000 is the key resistance that can keep the bounce in check. Thus I am expecting a consolidation in the next week, which can unfold in the wide range of 8,000-9,000.""

Q) What is the way ahead for Indian markets?
Any important levels to track for the coming week which will also be the expiry week for Indian markets?
A) Indian markets are expected to witness a bounce back given all the negativity is already priced in.
But, a massive bounce is unlikely unless we reclaim the entry above 9,500 and sustain those levels.","Indian markets are expected to witness a bounce back given all the negativity is already priced in. However, the 9000 levels on the Nifty50, does seem to be a strong resistance level.","A) Post the ferocious grip of bears, Indian markets now seem to be stabilizing. Certain pockets of sectors are also showing signs of capitulation.

Given that India VIX is stable and sentiments are steady, it seems that the markets have priced in the pandemic's fears. A small bounce from the current levels seems likely in line with the US.

However, if the situation escalates then there can be further decline which can be witnessed only as time goes by. But, till then it seems that markets have factored in all the adversities.

Q) What is the way ahead for Indian markets? Any important levels to track for the coming week which will also be the expiry week for Indian markets?

A) Indian markets are expected to witness a bounce back given all the negativity is already priced in. Since the fall was too rapid from highs of 12,200 levels, an immediate upward movement to those levels is impossible for now.

However, the 9000 levels on the Nifty50, does seem to be a strong resistance level for the bourses in the coming week. But, a massive bounce is unlikely unless we reclaim the entry above 9,500 and sustain those levels.

Q) Many stocks have declared a dividend in March. Is it because of the FY ending?

A) Union Budget 2020 presented the removal of dividend distribution tax (DDT) which would be applicable from the financial year 2020-2021.

The applicability of DDT made dividends tax-free in the hands of recipient and removal of the same have made dividend a part of income.

Hence, several companies are taking the opportunity to distribute dividends which would be tax-free to recipients paying DDT on dividends.

Q) Looking at the recent fall some reports have surfaced that promoters have started buying the shares. Can this environment can turn out to be a good buyback opportunity?

A) It is said that probably the best possible use of cash by businesses is when stocks can be bought below its intrinsic value – this applies to buybacks as well.

However, the applicability of recent buyback tax makes the promoters wary of going ahead with buybacks. It is best suited for the promoters to increase their holdings where possible.

And, if the promoters are of the view that the business is currently trading way below their intrinsic value, they may give a heads up for a buyback.

Q) Rupee breached Rs 75/USD last week. What led to the fall and what is the way ahead for the currency and the stocks which are likely to benefit the most from the sudden depreciation?

A) The main reason for the depreciation in the rupee v/s the dollar this week can be attributed to the FPIs selling spree in India. The global basket selling trend strengthened the dollar further.

However, going ahead markets are expected to stabilise with no significant depreciation in the Indian rupee since selling pressure is expected to ease. IT and pharma names such as TCS, Infosys, Sun Pharma are likely to benefit.

Q) More than 50% of the Nifty50 stocks have touched their 52-week/multi-year lows. Is there any historic reference that suggests that the worst is over, and should investors base their decision to buy stocks based on stocks that are hitting their record lows?

A) This week the US markets witnessed buying in marquee names such as Apple, Alphabet which indicates that stocks have factored in most of the negativity.

In the past too, it has been observed that large-caps experience massive selling when it's the last leg of the fall.

Considering the same, it can be said that we are in that very same stage before we can see bounces in our bourses. Therefore, investors can slowly start accumulating strong businesses that have the potential to tide through tough times.

Buying only based on a correction would be an inappropriate strategy since a stock at its 52-week low could be a weak business and will eventually turn out to be a value destructor in the long run just like a DHFL or an RCOM. Hence, investors should be in search of good businesses rather than 52-week low stocks.

Q) Any top five stocks which you think are looking attractive based on either fundamentals or technicals post recent meltdown?

A) Here is a list of top five stocks which investors could look at for a long term basis:

ITC:

ITC has very strong cash reserves to sustain the short-term uncertainty and a possible slowdown. The valuations have also become cheap, and the company has also decided to increase its dividend payouts for the medium-term which makes it attractive.

The company's stock price is showing good momentum in recent times against its peers.

Hero MotoCorp:

Hero MotoCorp is a strong bet on India's rural growth recovery. A strong Rabi season and higher crop prices are expected to boost the rural economy, thus benefitting Hero the most.

It is the world's largest two-wheeler maker and has been trading at an all-time low P/E multiple of 10x.

Having corrected by over 40 percent recently from the high due to the shutdown of multiplexes all over the country allows long-term investors to enter this stock at a cheap price.

The company has healthy financials and liquidity which provide comfort. A significant part of the company's operating cost is variable which will reduce costs during the period of closure.

The company's profits will be affected in the short-term but we expect a bounce-back as soon as the multiplex is up and running.

Bajaj Finance:

It is one of the very few large-caps that manage to post solid growth numbers above 30% every quarter. Company fundamentals remain intact.

The company has managed to post good numbers even in the difficult quarter gone by. Recent correction is an opportunity to enter.

Abbott India:

This Company stood strong despite the crash in the markets which brings out the quality in its business. It has resilient financials with positive free cash flow, net debt-free structure and lastly a structured portfolio with niche businesses.

Some brokerages say India's banking sector is staring at a renewed liquidity crisis and HDFC Bank, too, will face challenges going forward.
Global brokerage firm Bernstein said HDFC Bank may face tough times ahead.
Credit Suisse said HDFC Bank is among its top picks as the bank is well capitalised and competitively well-positioned at this juncture.
Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services, also has HDFC Bank in his model portfolio.","Since February 1, the stock has corrected 25 percent against a nearly 35 percent fall in the Nifty Bank index.","The HDFC Bank was under strong pressure, as the stock price fell almost 8 percent in the morning trade on NSE on March 20.

The stock has taken a beating, with the market seeing a sharp coronavirus-driven selloff. Since February 1, the stock has corrected 25 percent against a nearly 35 percent fall in the Nifty Bank index.

However, the stock has been a favourite of investors for a long time and some call it a compounding machine. The bank's wider market penetration, loan book and its stable asset quality make it a top pick for brokerages and investors.

But the coronavirus outbreak has caused serious disruption in the market and the economy. Some brokerages say India's banking sector is staring at a renewed liquidity crisis and HDFC Bank, too, will face challenges going forward.

Brokerages have mixed views on HDFC Bank. While some see the bank facing challenges, others say the bank is strong enough to withstand the headwinds.

Tough times ahead?

Credit Suisse warns that liquidity constraints will aggravate the credit crunch in the economy, whereas asset quality outlook becomes more uncertain in the face of economic disruption.

Global brokerage firm Bernstein said HDFC Bank may face tough times ahead. Bernstein has downgraded the stock to “underperform”, with a target price of Rs 750, implying a 16 percent downside.

""HDFC Bank, being a quality franchise, has weathered crises well in the past and has often been seen as a safe haven. However, in the current pandemic driven environment. we believe HDFC Bank carries certain idiosyncratic risks and unique management challenges,"" said Bernstein.

The brokerage highlighted that HDFC Bank's portfolio is most exposed to unsecured consumer credit risk versus peer private banks. Its subsidiary, HDB Financial Services, could also pose challenges, given the focus on weaker informal income segments. Further, the bank's non-proactive handling of the management succession, so far, could impact the bank's preferred status amongst the investor community, Bernstein said.

The virus outbreak, too, will have a negative impact on Indian banks as they will face operational and credit quality challenges, it said.

""Covid-19 will have a non-trivial impact on the Indian economy, even though the outbreak intensity so far does not point to a Europe or US-like scenario. But given the population size, density, community awareness, quality of infrastructure and global interlinkages, Indian businesses will still undergo disruption. Consequently, banks are likely to face operational and credit-quality challenges,"" said the brokerages.

""For FY'21E, we expect the earnings growth to slow down to sub-15 percent growth. We expect the succession challenges to impact its premium valuation multiples. We expect a 33 percent compression of its 1-year forward target multiple to13 times earnings, compared to its 5-year long term average of 21 times earnings,"" said Bernstein.

Target Investing founder Sameer Kalra has a negative view on the stock.""We have a negative view on the stock, given the change the management is due and the unsecured book is high. Also, provisions in the last three quarters have been consistently rising that would impact the premium on valuations,"" he said.

But still a top pick

Even as the stock has suffered losses in recent times, it remains a top pick for brokerages, thanks to its strong market presence.

Global brokerage firm UBS has maintained a “buy” call on HDFC Bank, with a target price at Rs 1,480, which is a 65 percent upside from the previous day's close of the stock at Rs 895.55.

UBS said it does not expect any significant impact on the bank's asset quality and highlighted that the trends in the unsecured retail asset quality of the bank are stable.

As much as 80 percent of unsecured loans are to the salaried employees and repayments continue to remain healthy currently, UBS said.

As per the brokerage, the bank's 70-75 percent of SME loans are secured, while the bank has low exposure to airlines and is limited to restaurants and hospitality businesses.

Credit Suisse said HDFC Bank is among its top picks as the bank is well capitalised and competitively well-positioned at this juncture.

Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services, also has HDFC Bank in his model portfolio.

ConclusionWe recommend buying ITC Limited (ITC) around Rs 165-160 levels with a stop loss of Rs 145 for higher targets of Rs 199 and Rs 210 levels as indicated in the above chart.",We recommend buying ITC Limited (ITC) around Rs 165-160 levels with a stop loss of Rs 145 for higher targets of Rs 199.,"Shabbir Kayyumi

The Commodity Channel Index (CCI) is an oscillator originally developed in 1980 by Donald Lambert and featured in his book ""Commodities Channel Index: Tools for Trading Cyclical Trends"". The commodity channel index (CCI) is an oscillator used to identify cyclical trends in indices, ETFs, stocks, and commodities.

CCI measures the difference between a security's price change and its average price change. High or positive readings indicate that prices are well above their average, which shows strength. Low or negative readings indicate that prices are well below their average, which shows weakness.

This indicator measures the current price level relative to an average price level over a given period of time; however, the default period is taken as 20. The CCI can be adjusted to the timeframe of the market traded on by changing the averaging period.

Why buy 'ITC'?

There are a lot of trading strategies that put CCI into use. The below mentioned one is one of the most popular among the trading community which involves buying after bullish divergence formation and keeping low as a stop loss for higher movement. However, support of another indicator Bollinger Band can give additional support.

Recently, the stock logged a key low of Rs 135 and managed to close higher above the previous five days' high indicating bulls are active on lower levels and strong buying is emerging below Rs 140 mark. At the same time, CCI traded below -250 which is called as oversold or reversal levels and the possibility of bouncing back towards neutral levels of 0 is very high. Prices traded lower but closed above lower Bollinger band with a big bullish candlestick pattern also suggest buying setup and prices can move towards the middle band of Bollinger Band.

Moreover, CCI placed a higher low compared to earlier low, forming bullish positive divergence which implies bottoming out process and it suggests buy on dip strategy. Currently, the ITC is going through this setup and we expect higher price movement towards resistance zone standing around Rs 199-210 levels in the coming days.

Figure .1. CCI divergence and Buy signal on ITC

Buy Signal

1.> Recent CCI gave a breakdown and published swing low around Rs 135 levels.2.> After marking low of (-400), CCI is retracing towards mid-line standing around 0 marks.3.> Strong bullish candle formation near buying zone has given us confirmation of trend reversal in short term.4.> Short term moving average 20 DMA placed around Rs 182 levels, suggesting prices can retrace towards it.

5.> Decent volume participation while forming bullish candle has also given additional confirmation.

Profit Booking:-

Whenever price candle will be near the resistance line which is near Rs 199 levels.

Stop Loss:-

The entire bullish view negates on breach of the last two candles low and one should exit from the long position. In case of ITC it is standing around Rs 145 marks closing basis.

Conclusion

We recommend buying ITC Limited (ITC) around Rs 165-160 levels with a stop loss of Rs 145 for higher targets of Rs 199 and Rs 210 levels as indicated in the above chart.

"March 22, 2020 04:03 PM IST",-1,Kshitij Anand,3Cs rattle markets! Corporate earnings are bound to take a hit,"The 3 C's - coronavirus pandemic, crude oil slippage and the credit risk averseness witnessed are cumulatively causing panic on the D-Street.
A) There is bound to be an earnings hit amidst the supply constraints and demand is expected to recover gradually.
Generally, there is going to be an earnings hit and the annualized earnings for this fiscal shall be trimmed down.
But, the consensus is pointing to a higher single-digit annualized earnings hit.
Q) Some analysts suggest that Covid-19 is nothing like that what financial markets have faced in the past – so the outcome for financial markets would not be similar.","The 3 C's - Coronavirus pandemic, Crude Oil slipping and the Credit risk averseness witnessed are cumulatively causing panic on the D-Street.","Fear and panic are not the equity market's best friends. The 3 C's - coronavirus pandemic, crude oil slippage and the credit risk averseness witnessed are cumulatively causing panic on the D-Street, Mayuresh Joshi, Head of Equity Research - India, William O'Neil India, said in an interview with Moneycontrol's Kshitij Anand.

edited excerpts:

Q) The Sensex broke below 30,000 to hit a fresh 3-year low and is down more than 12 percent in the week ended March 20. An enormous amount of wealth has been already eroded. What is causing the panic in the market, is it fear driving it downwards?

A) Fear and panic are not the equity market's best friends. The 3 C's - coronavirus pandemic, crude oil slippage and the credit risk averseness witnessed are cumulatively causing panic on the D-Street.

The magnitude of the unknowns as to how the contagion might spread further and when it shall peak is causing enormous disturbances in lockdown areas across the globe.

This is leading to the widespread expectations that global GDP might taper downwards and have a cyclical effect in terms of economic activity.

Additionally, job markets, as well as various industries, feel the pinch as the demand curve starts coming off. Though central governments and regulators across the globe are placating and soothing investor sentiments with huge liquidity doses for the probable economic fallout in the weeks and months to come, the markets are singularly focussed on the entire coronavirus threat.

Crude slipping with the Saudi-Russia deal off the table as demand is expected to contract across the globe has added to the panic and the earnings downgrades for various sectors have also contributed to the incessant selling witnessed.

Q) What would you advise investors who are left with bleeding portfolios even if they have invested in mutual funds?

A) Investors who are invested in mutual funds have done so with a long-term objective, and with dual goals of beating inflation and other asset classes.

Though equities might have underperformed in the short-term and the near-term cyclicality plays out in the markets, the long-term returns as historically proven have delivered comparatively better returns.

Q) Gold and Oil and equities all moving in one direct – what does it tell us or how should investors decode this?

A) It is indeed very surprising as Gold is one of the safe-haven assets in terms of crisis, as equities and oil will still be moving southwards for reasons mentioned above.

The only plausible explanation is that the severity and unknown duration of the economic stress is causing financial and economic deleveraging across asset classes.

Q) Many investors want to take advantage of the fall in the markets but have no fire powder – what would be your advice?

A) It would be an ideal situation for investors to start a small SIP to take advantage of the market fall and average the purchases over a period of time.

Q) FIIs have been pulling out money from markets across the globe and India is no exception – what is troubling FIIs – is it the margin pressure redemption, ETF selling or just that smart money moving towards safe havens?

A) The uncertainty in terms of the financial and economic deleveraging happening across the globe is prompting FIIs to trim their riskier asset exposures including equities and moving towards safe havens and treasuries.

Q) With recession fears looming I think investors could say goodbye to an earnings recovery for at least 2 quarters —what is the kind of earnings cut you are factoring in amid slowdown?

A) There is bound to be an earnings hit amidst the supply constraints and demand is expected to recover gradually. The Q1 numbers shall obviously take a hit and certain sectors such as travel and hospitality, film exhibition, the leisure industry, Capital goods industry might feel the brunt which is sharper compared to the others.

Generally, there is going to be an earnings hit and the annualized earnings for this fiscal shall be trimmed down. Index earnings hit can be to the tune of 8-10% with the caveat that things might normalise over the next few weeks, for if it lingers longer we might be staring at deeper cuts.

But, the consensus is pointing to a higher single-digit annualized earnings hit.

Q) Some analysts suggest that Covid-19 is nothing like that what financial markets have faced in the past – so the outcome for financial markets would not be similar. It has far-reaching effects than previously seen epidemics. Does that mean to stay away from equities?

A) Yes, the financial crisis in 2008 had known factors but here we are staring at a Tsunami in the form of the coronavirus which has no possible solution as of now.

The logic of the unknown and the contagion risk has shuddered the equity markets. Unlike other epidemics in the past where market correction ensued, this correction has been brutal. Our take is to let the markets stabilize for a few days.

In fact, 3 days of consistent price action with volumes would justify that the markets are attempting a 'rally' and as a follow-through day which follows this time horizon. This takes the price and volume action stronger and in a more positive zone.

The markets would be in a strong and stable territory. So, one needs to stay in equities depending on his/her % diversification and shortlist companies having a strong earnings pedigree, where chart bases have developed strongly along with RSI movements and enter at the opportune time as mentioned above.

The shares were pledged to HSBC Investdirect Financial Services India on March 6, 2020, a day after the Reserve Bank of India superseded its board and brought the bank under a moratorium that ended March 18.

The stock had gained 1,484 percent in just eight trading sessions as the cabinet approved the RBI's restructuring plan for the private lender.

The RBI, State Bank of India and new CEO & MD Prashant Kumar's assurances to depositors boosted investors' confidence who bought the stock as other shares crashed over coronavirus fears.

But brokerages are not convinced with the rally and some of them have suspended their coverage or maintained a “sell” rating on the stock.

The rally is more technical than fundamental, as while the capital infusion and AT1 bonds write-off has helped Yes Bank stay afloat, its fundamentals still remain weak, JM Financial has said.

A loss of more than Rs 18,500 crore reported by the bank in Q3FY20 with pro-forma CET1 at 7.6 percent (post capital infusion and AT1 write-off) clearly shows the problem.

According to a Twitter poll commissioned by Moneycontrol, a majority of Yes Bank customers will withdraw the entire money deposited in the troubled lender, which required a government-led bailout.

Up to 53 percent of the respondents said they would take their money out, the poll commissioned on March 18 found. Only 27.4 percent said they would keep their money, while 7.2 percent said they would deposit more money in their accounts.

The stock, which has zoomed more than 85 percent in the last five days, was quoting at Rs 46.40, down Rs 14.40, or 23.68 percent. It touched an intraday high of Rs 62.00 and an intraday low of Rs 45.15.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/yes-bank-share-price-tanks-25-after-promoter-madhu-kapur-sells-shares-worth-rs-161-crore-5049701.html

Higher volatility will keep exerting pressure on the market and traders till it comes off its historic highs.

Some midcaps stocks for this tough timeThere are some midcap stocks that you may consider for a long-term horizon.","Factoring in the worst, Morgan Stanley has warned investors that the seismic waves of COVID-19 are likely to trigger a global recession.","Investors are facing a torrid time as equities seem to be caught in an unending cycle of loss, with benchmarks Sensex and Nifty tanking almost every day as coronavirus infections continue to spike across the world.

Volatility is surging and investor sentiment is unusually low. India's volatility index India VIX has jumped over 400 percent in the calendar year 2020, so far.

Higher volatility will keep exerting pressure on the market and traders till it comes off its historic highs. The situation will prevail till coronavirus cases begin to decline.

Governments and several central banks have come out with measures to ensure liquidity and stability in the financial system but they have not been able to get the desired result.

Factoring the worst, Morgan Stanley, in a note on March 17, warned investors that the seismic waves of coronavirus are likely to trigger a global recession.

Under the base case scenario for India, Morgan Stanley estimates India's growth rate at around 4.5 percent till Q4CY20 and in bear case, it could be near 4 percent.

Even as experts and brokerages say the market is near its bottom and a rise is imminent, they warn against getting carried away and advise prudence while investing at this juncture.

History shows that every time the market witnesses a steep fall, a phase of rebound follows.

Brokerage firm Prabhudas Lilladher said after a year of similar virus outbreaks, the Sensex jumped 83 percent.

Anecdotal data suggest that usually declines in the index have not gone further than 25-28 percent, hence a recovery could be in sight. The last time when the Nifty50 entered the bear phase in 2015, it took around two years to recover.

Some midcaps stocks for this tough time

There are some midcap stocks that you may consider for a long-term horizon. They are available at reasonable or rather cheaper valuation and look poised for good returns.

Ashok Leyland, ABB India, Bharat Forge, Biocon, Coromandel, Dalmia Bharat, V-Mart Retail and United Breweries are some of the mid-cap names that look like a good investment.

""We recommend investors to capitalise the capitulation, endure the pain at this last stage of the down-cycle and to stretch the horizon to visualise beyond what is apparent, but do not risk missing out on the potential rewards,"" Spark Capital said in a report.

Exhibit 2 shows break-up of PVR's cost structure,"" said the brokerage.
As per our estimate, PVR would incur cost of Rs 750 per month in the event of a complete shutdown.
The brokerage estimates EBITDA loss of Rs 60 crore per month (Rs 750 on cash basis) and cash loss (including interest expense) of Rs 85 crore per month.
""PVR has utilised available working capital facility of about Rs 150 crore and increased cash-levels to about Rs 200-250 crore.","The sharp correction from peak presents an opportunity to buy this stock at an attractive valuation, Kotak feels","Shares of multiplex chain PVR tumbled about 46 percent in the last one month amid mounting COVID-19 fears.

Investors are concerned that the shutdown of multiplexes, malls along with shelving of shootings will take a toll on the quarterly earnings of the entertainment company.

In the face of the massive correction, Kotak Institutional Equities has upgraded the scrip to a buy from reduce with a target of Rs 1,800 (reduced from Rs 1,850 earlier).

""While Covid-19 would significantly impact the business in the short term (say two months), we expect it to bounce back, thereafter, led by pent-up demand and a packed line-up of movies,"" said the brokerage which cut FY2020-21E EBITDA estimates by 10-23 percent and retained FY2022 estimates.

The sharp correction from peak presents an opportunity to buy this stock at an attractive valuation, it feels.

The novel coronavirus, which first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019, has now spread to 166 countries and territories, killing more than 8,600 people and leaving hundreds of thousands in quarantine.

The highly infectious disease is spreading rapidly in Europe and the United States, forcing shut down of offices, schools, cafes, cinema halls, malls-- basically upending normal life.

India is also seeing a steady rise in cases. So far, it has reported three deaths and 166 confirmed cases.

""We assess potential short-term impact of Covid-19 on PVR's financials assuming a complete shutdown for two months (base case). Exhibit 2 shows break-up of PVR's cost structure,"" said the brokerage.

Film hire costs, F&B cost of goods sold, electricity are variable costs. Employee costs (permanent + contractual workforce) and other expenses (travel costs, repair & maintenance, advertising and other G&A expenses) are semi-variable in nature.

""Even as rental cost is largely fixed (fixed rent or MG + revenue share), several lease contracts have a provision for partial/complete waiver in situations such as this. As per our estimate, PVR would incur cost of Rs 750 per month in the event of a complete shutdown. Cash inflow would be nil during this period and revenues would be booked at Rs 15 crore per month (amortization of BookMyShow/Paytm convenience fee deal),"" Kotak said.

The brokerage estimates EBITDA loss of Rs 60 crore per month (Rs 750 on cash basis) and cash loss (including interest expense) of Rs 85 crore per month. ""PVR has utilised available working capital facility of about Rs 150 crore and increased cash-levels to about Rs 200-250 crore. Net debt as of date is about Rs 920 crore.

However, Kotak expects a strong bounce back in demand post-Covid-19 led by (1) pent-up demand, and (2) packed line-up of movies (Q4FY20/1QFY21 releases deferred would be scheduled during Q2-Q4FY21).

Further, the brokerage believes that PVR's performance is largely linked to content quality and weak macro has a modest impact on the operating performance.

Given this, it expects footfalls to largely recover post-Covid-19 even in case of some incremental weakness in macro. ""That said, we note that advertising revenue growth could decelerate if the economy slows down further.""

""We like PVR for its (1) thought leadership, (2) premium location presence and branding, (3) leadership in monetization and profitability, and (4) execution track record,"" it said.

Stock prices have come down to levels unimaginable just a month back. And yet few are willing to call a bottom, as authorities across the globe struggle to contain the epidemic.

So what should an investor do in such a market?

CNBC-TV18 spoke to these veteran market experts during the course of the day and this is what they had to say:

Samir Arora, Helios Capital

There is no point in trying to find a bottom. Investors should sit on the sidelines for now. We are not looking at any bargain buying for now. Economic recovery will take longer than the stock market recovery.

Arvind Sanger, Geosphere

There will be more pain in India (Indian market), valuations are not attractive yet. We are buying, but very slowly. One can look at high-quality banks and companies with exposure to the rural economy. I am positive on companies related to healthcare directly and indirectly. Banks' valuations are getting attractive, but investors seem to be lacking confidence.

Sunil Singhania, Abakkus Asset Management

Even die-hard optimists like me are finding it difficult to invest until stability returns. It is hard to call this a bottom, but valuations certainly are compelling. Have started deploying money in the last 2-3 days. We will buy more once volatility reduces.

Andrew Holland, Avendus Capital

No matter how low interest rates are, there is no cash flow to service the loans. Companies will have a cash flow and payment problem due to CoVid-19 disruption. Even if there is a ban on short selling, it will not work in the present environment.

S Naren, ICICI Prudential Asset Management

Investors must double on their investments at current valuations. This is the time to invest and forget. You will never have markets so cheap without a problem.

Venugopal Garre, Sanford Bernstein

Nifty should bottom out at 14-15 times price earning. One should look at large caps with good free cash flow and low debt. We are positive on stocks like Maruti, Reliance, TCS. Investors should focus on quality of the bank's loan book, not valuations or growth. We are positive on Kotak Mahindra Bank and Bajaj Finance.

Ajay Srivastava, Dimensions Capital

Among the blue-chip stocks, ITC is a stock which, brokerages say, has corrected sharply and is now ready to move upward.

As of March 19 close, shares of ITC have fallen 32 percent on BSE in the calendar year 2020, in sync with a 31 percent fall in Sensex during the same period.

Brokerage firm JM Financial finds the stock too cheap to ignore.

""We see deep value in the stock at the current price and find it too cheap to ignore. ITC's operating profit growth even during the past three years (FY16-19) was at 8.4 percent CAGR –a pace similar to that of Asian Paints' (8.4 percent CAGR) and much higher vs Dabur's (4.6 percent) but its stock price is down more than 25 percent over the past four years while Asian Paints' the stock has doubled and Dabur's has grown 73 percent during the same period.,"" said JM Financial.

The brokerage has a 'buy' call on the stock with a target price of Rs 315, which is a 95 percent upside from the current market price of the stock at Rs 161.95. As per the estimates of the brokerage, ITC currently trades at a headline PE of 11.5 times on a one-year forward basis (based on FY21 EPS) and 10.4 times on FY22 basis.

JM Financial highlighted that ITC's headline one-year forward PE multiple is now less than 12 times, which is at a discount to Nifty50 and also 50 percent below its own five-year and ten-year PE averages. The implied PE (FY21 basis) for the cigarettes business is 7 times – lower than even most global tobacco stocks.

Moreover, The implied PE (FY21 basis) for the cigarettes business is 7 times which is lower than even most global tobacco stocks.

ITC's huge cash surplus hints that the dividend payout may move up going forward.

""ITC's net-cash surplus is estimated to be Rs 36,100 crore at March 2020-end against Rs 30,700 crore at March 2019-end and the company's yearly FCFF (free cash flow to the firm) generation is of the order of more than Rs 10,000 crore. The huge cash-surplus at its disposal (about 70 percent of annual revenue, 19-20 percent of market cap), there is a clear case for

dividend payout ratio to move up from 72-73 percent in recent years (average) to more than 80 percent going forward,"" JM Financial said.

The brokerage also added that the company has recently updated its dividend policy which now cites a payout ratio of 80- 85 percent of post-tax profit over the medium-term – this would peg dividend per share at more than Rs 10 for FY20E which would translate into a dividend yield of more than 6.5 percent at the current market price.

Brokerage firm ICICI Securities, too, has a 'buy' call on ITC with a target price of Rs 220, an upside of 36 percent.

The brokerage said with the increase in the guided payout ratio to 80-85 percent from nearly 70 percent currently, ITC has addressed an important investor concern of capital allocation – particularly hotels capex which has mostly been EVA (economic value added) negative.

The brokerage expects ITC stock to rerate as, over the past two decades, big rerating events for ITC were steep jumps in the dividend pay-out to 40-45 percent range over FY05-09 from 30-35 percent range earlier and then the second instance of increasing it to 65-70 percent range in FY10 from 45-50 percent range earlier.

ICICI Securities said its earnings estimates for ITC are broadly unchanged and it had only adjusted for higher dividend payment. ""We are modelling revenue/EBITDA/PAT CAGR of 9/8/5 percent, respectively, over FY20-22E,"" ICICI said.

Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services is of the view that ITC's dividend payout increase acts as a silver lining at a time when pace of near term earnings growth for the company is uncertain given weak performance of late and the NCCD increase in the budget.

The brokerage currently has a 'neutral' call on the stock with a target price of Rs 196 which is a 21 percent upside.

Factoring the worst, Morgan Stanley in a note on March 17, warned investors that the seismic waves of COVID-19 are likely to trigger a global recession. S&P Global in a note said that the coronavirus outbreak has plunged the world's economy into a global recession.

At a time when the global economy is going through a recession, India Inc. is likely to face a rub-off effect which will in turn impact demand and earnings.

Some brokerage firms are already discounting a double-digit earnings cut in low teens while some sectors are likely to get positively impacted by the Covid-19 outbreak.

Coronavirus is having a major impact on the global economy and the stock markets across the globe. India is among the top 15 economies which are most affected due to this pandemic.

The positive side for the Indian economy is the significant correction in the crude oil prices as India imports 85% of its oil needs which is the silver lining, suggest experts. Sectors that are defensive in nature as well as focused towards consumption are likely to do well along with insurance sectors.

“An intermittent rally in sectors like insurance, industrial gases & fuels and retail could be possible as the advance-decline ratio of these sectors is greater than or equal to 0.50 on MoM basis,” Gaurav Garg, Head of Research at CapitalVia Global Research Limited- Investment Advisor told Moneycontrol.

“This implies that most of the stocks in the above-mentioned sectors are still considered to be bullish and hold the potential to generate good returns in the near future as per investor's sentiments,” he said.

We also spoke to various experts on sectors which are likely to drive next leg of the rally in the market as and when dust settles:

Expert: Ajit Mishra, VP Research, Religare Broking

After a significant correction and high volatility in the Indian markets, we would advise investors to invest in defensive sectors like Consumer Durables, Paints and Pharma Space as they would be first amongst other sectors that would witness a reversal, with recovery in the markets.

Banking/NBFCs:

Also investing in large private Banking/NBFC would be considered as a safe bet. Going forward, in the medium to long-term we expect a recovery in the FMCG/ Consumer Durables sectors with improvement in the overall economy and uptick in demand.

Paint:

The Paints sector would benefit from lower crude oil prices and recovery in the consumption cycle.

Pharma:

Pharma counters are expected to be immune to the economic slowdown and we believe these counters have been in focus post the virus breakout.

Expert: Ritesh Asher – Chief Strategy Officer (CSO) at KIFS Trade Capital

FMCG:

We have a strong bet for the FMCG sector as this sector stand to gain from the slide in crude prices since many companies use oil and its derivatives in their products.

Demand will surge especially on a day to day essentials consumer products as they have high growth potential and with ongoing health circumstances, people will invest more in hygiene products.

Insurance sector:

The Indian life insurance industry has evolved in the last two decades post privatization of the industry in 2000. While growth has been aided by strong capital markets, there have also been interim setbacks in the form of regulatory changes. The private players have shown healthy growth since 2014.

Going forward, insurers are well poised to maximize the long term growth potential of the industry on the back of a stable regulatory environment, favorable demographics and increasing digital adoption by the customers.

These are few factors outlining the same as changing demographic profile & low insurance penetration. Keeping these factors in mind insurance industry have big scope in coming fiscal years and currently looking at fundamentals many stocks are available at attractive valuations.

Bharti Airtel is our preferred pick in the telecom sector,"" ICICI Sec said.",Most brokerages think that the telecom sector is moving towards a duopoly structure and Airtel and Reliance Jio are well placed for this.,"Shares of telecom player Bharti Infratel cracked up to 19 percent in morning trade on BSE on March 19, a day after the Supreme Court of India refused to offer any further relief to the telecom companies with regards to the AGR dues.

Shares of Bharti Airtel fell up to 11 percent but those of Vodafone Idea jumped up to 7 percent in morning trade on BSE.

Hearing the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) plea in the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) case, a bench of the Supreme Court of India on March 18 held that no further objections to its orders would be allowed against payable dues.

Most brokerages think that the telecom sector is moving towards a duopoly structure and Airtel and Reliance Jio are well-placed for this.

Let's take a look at what the top brokerage think for the sector:

Credit Suisse

Global brokerage firm Credit Suisse said that SC's rejection of self-assessment of AGR dues is particularly negative for Vodafone Idea and the company's sustenance would remain under cloud without significant liquidity infusion.

On the other hand, Bharti Airtel would emerge as a key beneficiary of further market consolidation in a two-player scenario, Credit Suisse added.

The brokerage maintained its preference for Bharti Airtel and said its fair value could be Rs 622.

Morgan Stanley

Morgan Stanley is of the view that AGR issue could create a duopoly structure and Airtel and Reliance Jio are well placed for this.

""Due to strong balance sheets they could gain market share,"" Morgan Stanley said.

The global financial firm added that the bear case for Infratel increases if tenancy deletions from Vodafone Idea accelerate.

""Vodafone Idea's FY21 ARPU would need to be Rs 235 to be FCF break-even. The company's debt-to-EBITDA ratio is 30 times after building in total AGR liabilities,"" Morgan Stanley said.

Airtel's debt-to-EBITDA ratio is comfortable even after assuming AGR liabilities and despite correction, Morgan Stanley sees limited positive catalysts for Bharti Infratel.

Motilal Oswal Financial Services

The brokerage highlighted that Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea will now have to pay the entire AGR liability toward license and SUC charges of Rs 44,000 crore and Rs Rs 58,000 crore instead of Rs 34,300 crore and Rs 44,200 crore, respectively, provisioned in Q2FY20 and the recent self-assessment figures of Rs 13,000 crore and Rs 21,000 crore.

The brokerage, however, added that in a slight relief to telcos, the SC after two weeks will hear the DoT's proposal for a staggered payment of AGR dues by telcos over a period of 20 years at an 8 percent MCLR rate.

""In our view, Bharti should weather this storm through its recent fundraise. A duopoly market will likely benefit it (along with RJio) with incremental EBITDA potential of Rs 10000 crore in FY22 even after building in-network cost increase with blue-sky EBITDA of nearly Rs 55000 crore (on pre-Ind-AS 116),"" Motilal said.

ICICI Securities

In ICICI Sec's view, the DOT demand turns out to be much higher than provisioned by Bharti and Vodafone Idea at Rs 44000 crore and Rs 58300 crore, respectively.

""The only marginal positive is that the court has agreed to hear DOT plea for a rescue plan for telecom after two weeks,"" said the brokerage.

""Our analysis of the worst-case scenario of the Supreme Court rejecting rescue plan (though low probability), Bharti has cash close to AGR balance dues, while Vodafone Idea will struggle. Bharti Airtel is our preferred pick in the telecom sector,"" ICICI Sec said.

Traders are advised to buy the stock on a dip near Rs 70 for the target of Rs 84 with a stop loss of Rs 63.","With regard to the intermediate levels, 7,800 followed by 7,500 could be the next supports for Nifty","Mehul Kothari

There has been no respite for the bulls on D-Street so far during the week amid weakness in the global markets.

The domestic market witnessed severe selling for the fourth consecutive week, with the benchmark indices losing more than 15 percent.

Nifty closed near the 10,000-mark last week and has now breached the 8,000 level with ease.

At this juncture, it is trading with a cut of around 17 percent, while the Nifty Bank index has lost around 20 percent from the previous week to settle near the 20,000-mark.

At present, the technical supports are not working since the fall has more to do with the overall sentiment.

Earlier, we expected the 9,500–9,000 zone to attract some buying but that possibility has been ruled out as Nifty has breached the 8,000-mark.

Currently, the index is hovering near 8,000 level, which is the 78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of the entire rally from 6,826 to 12,430.

Further, there is a major hidden divergence in the monthly RSI of the Nifty index, and this will not be negated if 6,825 remains intact during this month.

Also, the momentum oscillators on all the timeframes are showing signs of exhaustion. Thus, the above-mentioned evidence indicates that the range of 8,000–7000 can be a place where the market is likely to bottom out.

With regard to the intermediate levels, 7,800 followed by 7,500 could be the next supports. On the other hand, in case of any recovery, 8,600 would be the first hurdle above which there could be strong bounce towards the 10,000-mark since the fall also was vertical.

Traders are advised to start picking quality Nifty50 stocks and deploy some of their capital in the range of 8,000–7,000.

Here are three buy calls for the next 3-4 weeks:

Reliance Industries (RIL) | Buy | LTP: Rs 917.70 | Target: Rs 1,100 | Stop loss: Rs 760 | Upside: 20%

During the recent fall, Reliance Industries has corrected more than 40 percent from the peak of Rs 1,600 to end near Rs 900 mark.

At present, the stock is approaching its 100-month exponential moving average, which is placed at Rs 800 and the stock has never breached this level convincingly since 1998.

This time, too, we feel that even in the worst-case scenario, Rs 800 could be the zone, which the bulls will try to protect.

Traders are advised to buy the stock on dip from Rs 900 to Rs 840 for the target of Rs 1,100 with a stop loss of Rs 760.

Tata Steel | Buy | CMP: Rs 272 | Target: Rs 330 | Stop loss: Rs 240 | Upside: 21.32%

During the ongoing crash, the Nifty Metal index has been one of the worst performers and has corrected almost 37 percent from a peak of 2,900.

Currently, the index is trading near the lower end of a falling channel, which it has been respecting since January 2018.

Being a high weightage candidate in the Nifty Metal index, Tata Steel also has a similar price structure and is trading very close to the lower end of the falling channel.

In addition, we are witnessing a positive divergence in the weekly and monthly chart of the stock which indicates the possibility of a bounce.

Traders are advised to buy the stock on a dip near Rs 270 for the target of Rs 330 with a stop loss of Rs 240.

Tata Motors | Buy | LTP: Rs 72.90 | Target: Rs 84 | Stop loss: Rs 63 | Upside: 15.22%

Since the beginning of the year, Tata Motors has crashed around 65 percent from its peak of Rs 202 to reach Rs 70-mark.

The stock has been trading in a highly oversold zone for several weeks.

At present, it is hovering near Rs 68 level, which is the potential reversal zone of the bullish AB=CD pattern formed by joining the swing highs and lows of Rs 240, Rs 106 and Rs 202.

The risk-reward ratio looks highly lucrative to go long for short-term traders.

Traders are advised to buy the stock on a dip near Rs 70 for the target of Rs 84 with a stop loss of Rs 63.

The S&P BSE Sensex plunged over 1,700 points to trade below 29,000 on on March 18 while Nifty50 broke below crucial support levels of 8,500 to hit a fresh 3-year low, tracking muted trend seen in other Asian and European markets.

Indian market fell tracking a sell-off in global markets. Dow Jones futures plunged more than 800 points (at 16:45 hours IST) as investors worried due to rising coronavirus epidemic, though the US government announced big stimulus to combat its economic fallout.

""The Trump administration on Tuesday unveiled a $1 trillion stimulus package that could deliver $1,000 cheques to Americans within two weeks to buttress an economy hit by coronavirus while many other governments look to fiscal stimulus,"" the report added.

We have collated a list of five factors which could be weighing on markets:

Morgan Stanley warns of global recession:

Factoring the worst, Morgan Stanley in a note on March 17, warned investors that the seismic waves of COVID-19 are likely to trigger a global recession.

""Global recession in 2020 is now our base case scenario,"" Morgan Stanley Chief Economist Chetan Ahya said in a note on March 17. “We expect 2020 global growth to dip to 0.9 percent, the lowest since the global financial crisis when global growth bottomed at -0.5 percent in 2009. This time will be worse than the global recession of 2001,” the note added.

Under the base case scenario for India, Morgan Stanley estimates India's growth rate at around 4.5 percent till Q4CY20, and in bear case, it could be near 4 percent.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the global investment bank expects, could slash policy rates by a cumulative 40-65 basis points in the second quarter of the calendar.

S&P lowers India's growth forecast to 5.2% in 2020

S&P Global Ratings on Wednesday lowered India's economic growth forecast to 5.2 percent for 2020, saying the global economy is entering a recession amid the coronavirus pandemic.

The agency had earlier projected a growth rate of 5.7 percent during the 2020 calendar.

Asia-Pacific economic growth in 2020 will more than halve to less than 3 percent as the ""global economy enters a recession"", S&P said in a statement.

India halts key policy plans as revenues shrink: sources

India has dropped at least three crucial policy initiatives, including lowering import taxes on vegetable oils, as the outbreak of the coronavirus hits government revenue collection, said a Reuters report quoting two sources said on Tuesday.

India's income tax revenues contracted 3.5 percent in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, which began in April 2019, and income from other taxes grew by a meager 3.8 percent, the finance ministry told parliament on Monday, said the report.

The food ministry had proposed lowering import taxes on crude and refined vegetable oils, including palm oil, by 3-7 percent to keep a lid on domestic prices that leapt more than 11% after India restricted palm oil imports from Malaysia in January.

Banking stocks plunge; lead sectoral fall

NiftyBank plunged nearly 6 percent, the lowest since February 2017. The fall in the index was led by losses in IndusInd Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank etc. among others.

“All industries got impacted by the novel coronavirus outbreak or COVID-19. One should definitely start buying quality stocks in tranches. The selling in large banks, IndusInd Bank, Axis Bank, etc. indicated that there is too much pessimism in the market due to expected weak global growth,” Siddharth Purohit of SMC Institutional Equities said in an interview with CNBC-TV18.

Shares of IndusInd Bank plunged more than 30 percent in intraday trade to hit a six-year low of Rs 382.55 on March 18 amid weak market conditions and no relief from Supreme Court to telecom players in the AGR case. The stock closed at Rs 459.85, down 23.90 percent.

IndusInd Bank has around 2 percent exposure to Vodafone Idea which could find it difficult to pay the entire amount on short notice.

The benchmark indices have fallen around 25 percent from the mid of February when the global markets realised the virus impact on China, followed by the spread of the virus to other parts of the world which made investors worry more.

If we compare the fall from record highs seen in January, the benchmark indices have lost nearly 28 percent now, while the Nifty Midcap index shed over 26 percent.

More than Rs 40 lakh crore worth of investor wealth has been eroded since the mid of February. Some experts feel it is 2008-kind of a situation as volatility is also quite high now and the market is reacting only to global cues.

Everyone on the Street agrees that no one can predict the top or bottom for the market, but given the quantum of fall in the market, valuations on all parameters look quite attractive and hence several quality stocks are available at a cheap price, experts feel.

""Now the valuations are comparatively looking good compared to what they have been in a long time. It is an excellent opportunity to start accumulating if you have money, invest some to it and wait for the markets to move from here,"" Jashan Arora, Director at Master Capital Services told Moneycontrol said.

Moneycontrol has collated a list of stocks that have been upgraded to a buy by brokerages in March.

These stocks could give 27-147 percent returns in the next one year. Returns are calculated based on the closing price of March 17.

Bajaj Auto: Buy | Target: Rs 3,100 | Return: 36 percent

Kotak Institutional Equities upgraded Bajaj Auto to buy (from reduce earlier) as valuations turn attractive given strong growth prospects in export markets.

""The domestic motorcycle segment forms only 10 percent of Bajaj Auto's EBITDA; hence impact on Bajaj Auto will be limited due to BS-VI transition. Export volume growth is strong currently and we built sufficient cushion in our numbers if oil prices remain depressed in the near term,"" said the brokerage.

Sobha: Buy | Target: Rs 465 | Return: 135 percent

Kotak upgraded Sobha to buy (from add) with a revised fair value estimate of Rs 465share (from Rs 515/share), saying the stock has corrected sharply over the past month, allowing sharp upside to revised fair value estimate.

""Current market price gives near no credit to the land bank of Rs26 bn that has traditionally been an area of debate for investors. In our view, concerns on promoter liquidity constraints are overplayed, and should be seen in the context of the purchase of stock by key management personnel over the past month,"" the brokerage said.

Lupin: Buy | Target: Rs 840 | Return: 36 percent

""The recent share price correction means that Lupin valuations reflect only domestic segment valuations, implying deep value and market's disappointments around the regulatory actions against its facilities as well as a lack of cost cuts, and implying no value to the US despite a strong pipeline build-out. However, we expect continued strong performance in India and EMs, and see levers for operating leverage starting with levo ramp from Q1FY21,"" said Kotak which upgraded the stock to buy.

Dalmia Bharat: Buy | Target: Rs 1,050 | Return: 93 percent

""Dalmia is progressing well to reach 37 mtpa capacity by FY2022E and would penetrate deeper into the West and East regions. With access to 20 states, Dalmia is no longer a regional player. Leverage is well controlled despite aggressive growth with net debt/EBITDA peaking at 1.7X in FY2020E,"" said Kotak which upgraded the stock to buy (from add) at an unchanged fair value of Rs 1,050.

The brokerage feels concerns on treasury appear overblown; resolution of the mutual fund case and divestment of IEX holding could trigger a re-rating. Valuations have corrected to an attractive 6X EV/EBITDA FY2022E, it said.

Bajaj Electricals: Buy | Target: Rs 500 | Return: 45 percent

JM Financial upgraded Bajaj Electricals to buy as it believes its risk-reward proposition has become attractive.

""Our thesis is based on the following: a) Bajaj Electricals' consumer business, whose performance has been strong in the past 3 quarters; it has the potential to improve margins and record a 15 percent CAGR in the medium term (robust distribution, impending rural recovery, etc.). b) its EPC business, which has been the biggest drag but should see some stability (despite expected losses for the next 2-3 quarters). c) Balance sheet improvement, led by a Rs 350 crore rights issue and collection of EPC receivables (significant reduction in interest costs),"" said the brokerage which rolled forward with a March 2021 target of Rs 500 (earlier September 2020 of Rs 440) and upgrade the stock on the recent correction.

V-Mart: Buy | Target: Rs 2,700 | Return: 52 percent

Motilal Oswal upgraded V-Mart to buy as it stands to benefit from (a) its strong cost leadership at a time when regional players are facing pressure, (b) tailwinds from better monsoon and agricultural output and (c) low SSSG/margin base.

Also, the correction in the stock price from its peak in Aug'18 provides an attractive entry point, the brokerage feels.

Marico: Buy | Target: Rs 315 | Return: 27 percent

""After the requisite (albeit admittedly delayed) price action in its largest brand, Parachute (around 30 percent of sales), Marico's overall volume growth outlook appears relatively better than peers, barring HUVR and Nestle. Further, demand for brands like Parachute, Saffola, VAHO and youth products are unlikely to be significantly affected by the Coronavirus,"" said Motilal Oswal which upgraded the stock to buy with a target of Rs 315.

Trailing FY20 valuations of 32.2x FY20E EPS and FY21/FY22 valuations of 33.4x/27.5x FY22E respectively (much lower than 3-year/5-year/10-year average of 44.8x/42.7x/ 35.2x) offer potential for upside, it feels.

Hindalco Industries: Buy | Target: Rs 220 | Return: 91 percent

""Hindalco (HNDL) fell sharply, factoring in an unrealistic scenario of demand and price collapse due to Covid-19 virus outbreak. The fall overlooks the strong quality of Novelis and resilient domestic operations. Admittedly, the impending acquisition of Aleris would increase the debt by $2.6 billion. However, diversified product mix and improvement in spreads present a better earnings outlook for Aleris. Given the attractive valuations due to the fall in stock price, we upgrade Hindalco to buy with tp of Rs 220, EV/EBITDA of 6x FY21e,"" Prabhudas Lilladher said.

Apar Industries: Buy | Target: Rs 587 | Return: 90 percent

Prabhudas Lilladher recently met Kushal Desai, CMD-Apar Industries (APAR), to gain insights on company's growth strategy and industry outlook.

""We came out positive and believe that recent price correction factors in most of the negative's, such as a) weak economic environment, b) tight liquidity scenario and c) subdued demand. In our view, APAR continuous to remain a proxy play to government efforts of reviving the power sector as 75 percent of domestic revenues are linked to power infrastructure,"" the brokerage said.

Further, the company's focus towards value-added products would help de-risk itself from low margin traditional business and help them gain market share given its superior product quality, first-mover advantage, and strong brand positioning both internationality and domestically, it added.

Prabhudas Lilladher expects revenue/PAT CAGR of 6/13 percent over FY19-21E. ""On account of change in revenue mix and factor in higher interest expense (despite lower guidance) we have reduced earnings estimates by 15.3/23.8 percent for FY21/FY22.""

The brokerage upgraded the stock to buy from accumulate with a revised TP of Rs 587 (12x FY22E) given its global leadership position, robust prospects of value-added products, strong positioning across product categories and consistent dividend pay-out.

Vodafone Idea: Buy | Target: Rs 12 | Return: 147 percent

CLSA has upgraded the telecom operator rating to buy from sell and raised target to Rs 12 from Rs 3.50 per share as it believes risks are overdone.

""Adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues will likely be 49 percent of ad-hoc provisions. Growth is set to accelerate, led by tariff hikes and cash EBITDA will triple by FY22. Market share in its top 10 circles is 1 ppt ahead of Bharti Airtel,' said the global brokerage.

It feels the company may even look to give up spectrum in its weak circles. ""Funding need will be $2.3 billion including hefty spectrum payments from FY23.""

Expert: Amit Gupta, Co-Founder, and CEO, TradingBellsKotak Mahindra Bank:Kotak Mahindra Bank has good profit growth of 20.63 percent over the past 5 years.
The company has shown 3-years average revenue growth 13 percent while the 3-years average profit growth at 19 percent.","Traders should adopt “Hit and Run guerrilla Trades” which means they should not take overnight positions, should respect the intraday trend and square up their positions in a day itself.","Benchmark indices have fallen more than 20 percent from their respective record highs registered in January effectively placing the Indian market in a bear phase.

So is the time right for value buying or is the market expected to fall more?

The first thing which one should understand is not to be under an illusion that they can time the market. Yes, the way this can be done is to deploy cash in markets in a staggered way.

“In this sharp decline, we are suggesting our clients begin their investments in quality stocks with 20-25 percent of their investment corpus designated for the equity asset class and infuse their capital slowly in the next 2-3 installments whereas traders should still remain cautious as market volatility will remain an intact cause of coronavirus crisis,” Amit Gupta, Co-Founder, and CEO, TradingBells told Moneycontrol.

“Traders should adopt “Hit and Run guerrilla Trades” which means they should not take overnight positions, should respect the intraday trend and square up their positions in a day itself,” he said.

The next question is how can one look at picking stocks? There will be a lot of beaten-down stocks that might be looking attractive from a price perspective, but are all of them a good buy? History, suggest otherwise.

The idea is to invest in stocks that have strong fundamentals because most of the decline is largely due to external factors. To start with, investors should analyze the core business of the company, balance sheet, profit, and loss statement, and valuations such as EPS, PE, ROCE as all these factors indicate the health of the company.

“Though there are many strategies to invest or select stocks, one should have a mix of value and growth stocks while constructing a portfolio,” Arun Kumar, Market Strategist at Reliance Securities told Moneycontrol.

“One can select stocks where the fundamental growth is consistent and the long-term business prospects are fairly decent. Also, many high dividend-yielding stocks are available at relatively cheap valuations which can also add value in the long run,” he said.

Kotak Mahindra Bank:

Kotak Mahindra Bank has good profit growth of 20.63 percent over the past 5 years. It has shown consistent growth since inception.

It is the third-largest bank in terms of market capitalization. The stock has corrected 50 percent from its last two years' move and recovered swiftly from there.

The company is virtually debt-free and has a good return on equity record of 37.88 percent in the last 3 years. The company has been maintaining a healthy dividend payout of 48.09 percent and sales growth of 11.67 percent.

On a technical chart, the counter has corrected more than 61% from its peak and has shown smart recovery from its Fibonacci retracement golden ratio of 61.8% marked at 2249 and manage to close at 2686.

If the stock manages to sustain above 2550 level then it may head towards 2860, 3238 levels in the near-term.

IRCTC enjoys the monopoly business practices in catering, watering, and e-ticketing for Indian railways. Increasing uses of the internet with improving consumption patterns of Indian consumers make the catering and water business more growing and fruitful.

The company is virtually debt-free and has a good ROE track record of 28.55 percent and a healthy dividend payout of 41.76 percent in the past 3 years.

The counter is also fairly valued to its value and has corrected more than 60 percent from its peak. A move above 1314 will take the rally towards 1314- 1474 mark in the near-term.

For paint companies, the fall in crude oil prices will be beneficial as crude oil derivatives are used as inputs for paints. Given that the entire benefit is unlikely to be passed on to the end consumer, there will be an expansion in margins. Asian Paints and Berger Paints should be major beneficiaries.

The Company offers an extensive range of IT services like application development, maintenance and outsourcing, enterprise solutions, infrastructure management services, testing, digital solutions and platform-based solutions to clients in diverse industries.

The company has an ROE track record of 34.09 percent of the past 3 years and virtually debt-free.

State Bank of India:

SBI is the largest public sector bank in terms of deposits, advances, customers, and banking outlets fostering the nation's 2.6 trillion-dollar economy.

Strong pipeline of recoveries up to 70 percent in 2020, healthy growth in the retail loan business is increasing. House loans grew by 17 percent, auto loans grew by 8.32 percent, and other P-segment loans grew by 5.06 percent. Steady asset quality makes SBI bank a good bet to buy.

New customer acquisition continued to be strong at 2.46mn, with total franchise came in at 40.38mn, over 24 percent growth on a YoY basis. Cross-sell franchise stood at 23.48mn, and the Asset under management (AUM) grew 35 percent on a YoY basis to Rs. 145,092cr.

Given the challenging macro conditions company's profit before tax grew 36.9 percent YoY, while the net profit surged 61 percent YoY largely attributable to the lower tax rate. Also, the stock is available at a discount price.

Wipro is a leading information technology, consulting and business process services company. The company had a dedicated workforce of over 180,000 serving clients across 6 continents.

If we consider the company's half-yearly performance it registered a 4 percent YoY hike in sales, which was accompanied by the company's cost optimization strategy and strong client relationships that will help the company gain lost ground in the long-term.

HDFC Bank has maintained a large stable asset quality with GNPAs between 0.9-1.4% over FY15-FY19. Over the last 10 quarters, the bank has seen NIMs sustain in the range of 4.2-4.3%.

Going forward, as and when the system-wide credit demand strengthens, the bank would be in a position to unlock NIMs by redeploying excess liquidity towards higher-yielding loan assets.

In the near term, while NIM could be under marginal pressure, operating leverage and lower credit costs would prop up RoA.

The company has shown 3-years average revenue growth 13 percent while the 3-years average profit growth at 19 percent.

The net worth of the company almost doubled in 4 years from FY15 to FY19. The company's 100 restaurant expansion strategy and split-store strategy with an increase in same-store sales growth (SSSG) look promising for further adding to the company's net profits.

The corporate tax cut will also add up on the company's favor and the debt to equity ratio remains NIL all this factor indicates healthy fundamentals of the company.

"March 18, 2020 10:50 AM IST",1,Shailendra Bhatnagar,Quality chemical stocks offer value in this crisis that 10 times worse than 2008: Shankar Sharma,"As always, global central bankers have swung into action to stave off a global economic collapse.
Indian stocks are worse off as foreign institutional investors pulled out more than Rs 45,000 crore from local equities, mostly frontline Nifty stocks since late February.
""The government has little room to manoeuvre this time and provide a sustained support to corporate India,"" Devina said.
There is a global economic dislocation never seen before, not even during the world wars.""
Investors keen to benefit from this sharp slide in stock values could invest up to 25 percent of their cash into select stocks, Sharma added.","Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have already predicted the world economy is headed for a recession. Clearly, the global pandemic initiated by the coronavirus has made bulls a near-extinct specie","Shankar Sharma and Devina Mehra are celebrating their 29th wedding anniversary in New Delhi. They are Indian stock market's first couple and what better time than this dislocated global economic scenario to have a wonderful, laid back lunch with them at Delhi's most fabulous restaurant, The Indian Accent.

Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have already predicted the world economy is headed for a recession. Clearly, the global pandemic initiated by the coronavirus outbreak has made bulls a near-extinct specie. And this time, the epicentre of the meltdown is Western Europe with Spain and Italy facing the brunt of this multiplying epidemic.

Meanwhile, US stocks plunged 32 percent from record peaks and the Nifty sawed off 28 percent from its record high of 12,430 points in less than a working month as the virus gnaws deeper into India's weakening economic health.

Mehra and Sharma – both ex-Citi bankers -- are founders of First Global, a securities firm having a presence in at least three continents and decades of cutting edge research backing it. The company offers personalised portfolio management services to the wealthy and manages its own money.

Sharma, 56, has an unerring track record of predicting bear markets and snaring bulls over the past three decades. He holds back nothing.

Devina, Chief Investment Strategist at First Global, on the other hand lets Shankar hog all the limelight but offers very lucid analyses on global and local events. She is an alumni of IIM-Ahmedabad. She majored in math and statistics. Is very well read and fond of Hindi Poetry.

Both are extremely serious foodies as they flip through the voluminous menu with practiced ease.

The setting is historical in more ways than just economics. Indian Accent is geographically placed on Lutyens' Delhi's beautifully tree lined Lodhi Road. On one side is Hazrat Nizamuddin's Dargah and on the other is Humayan's Tomb. Devina and Shankar are sitting in the Glass House surrounded by trees on all sides. The weather in Delhi is exceptional.

""This crisis is 10 times bigger than the 2008 bear market,"" Sharma said, adding the grim economic reality has made earnings outlook foggy. ""There are no models and no predictability. We used to see this in movies and I cannot believe that we have less than 150 infections in India....there just isn't enough testing.""

The virus, which originated in China in late 2019, has killed in excess of 7,000 people globally and has now spread to more than 160 countries. In India, the death toll stands at just three but Asia's third largest economy is on tenterhooks as it clamps down on public gatherings to shutting down schools, colleges, cinemas, malls and some government offices.

As always, global central bankers have swung into action to stave off a global economic collapse. Co-ordinated rate cuts and billions of dollars are being injected into the global financial system to provide support to beleaguered companies and crashing stock markets.

Equities, however, are not in listening mode. The Dow Jones Index has hit its first lower (8 percent) circuit twice in the past one week. Indian stocks are worse off as foreign institutional investors pulled out more than Rs 45,000 crore from local equities, mostly frontline Nifty stocks since late February. Lenders such as RBL Bank and IndusInd Bank are facing intense selling pressure owing to their stressed loan books.

""The government has little room to manoeuvre this time and provide a sustained support to corporate India,"" Devina said. ""Unlike 2008, India is not growing at 8-10 percent now and interest rates are already low. There is a global economic dislocation never seen before, not even during the world wars.""

The rupee, too, is in a tailspin, down to near record lows versus the dollar. Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of India swung into action on March 16, adding Rs 100,000 crore via long-term repo swap and said the Indian banking sector was on a strong footing. The markets, however, were expecting a rate cut to soothe strained nerves.

But Sharma said a probable rate cut is ""at best a Band-Aid solution. The RBI's tools are blunt instruments and not injections. They take time to work themselves out. We have already seen in the past two years that the RBI's policies have had little impact on economic growth.''

India's annual GDP expansion has slowed to sub-4 percent from a peak of 8.1 percent seen in Q4 FY18 as industrialists grapple with excess capacity and banks squeeze credit offtake in a bid to control rising non-performing assets. Demand for everything from cars, two-wheelers, homes and personal loans has fallen off the cliff.

Added to this grim reality is the economic dislocation caused by the rapid spread of the coronavirus. Sharma said local GDP will slow down further, in sync with its counterparts in China and elsewhere. Beijing, as it recovers from a debilitating corona attack, reported a 14.3 bps fall in industrial output for February.

""India's macro was anyways very, very slow for the past two years. The coronavirus problem will take time to go away and Indian GDP growth may be 1-2 percent in the coming quarters,"" Sharma said.

However, not all is bleak. Sharma said sliced stock prices present an opportunity to load up on quality stocks, especially those that will benefit from China's disturbed economic environment.

""One has to go for the least worse option in equities. There are 10-25 Indian stocks in the chemicals space that will emerge as winners after this crisis settles,"" Sharma said, adding the booming digital/new age stocks will throw a lot of winners like Amazon as more and more people shop online. Stocks such as Netflix and those related to video conferencing like Zoom Video Communications will prosper as quarantined millions stay and work out of homes, he added.

The other thing to pay critical attention would with asset allocations within portfolios, Devina said. ""There can't be a 100 percent weightage to stocks. Balance has to be in the form of gold and fixed income to tide of times like these.""

Investors keen to benefit from this sharp slide in stock values could invest up to 25 percent of their cash into select stocks, Sharma added.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/quality-chemical-stocks-offer-value-in-this-crisis-that-10-times-worse-than-2008-shankar-sharma-5045071.html

Benchmark Index Nifty breached 8,500-mark and closed below the same with a loss of 5.56 percent, forming a bearish candle, on March 18.

As per the moving average, Nifty has drifted below its 100-day exponential moving average on the monthly time frame.

The index has corrected almost 38.20 percent from the all-time high levels by connecting the lows of October 2008.

Nifty, on the monthly chart, has broken its 11-years rising channel pattern.

If the index closes below 8,800 level till March 2020 expiry, then the said bearish pattern will come to play.

The current chart structure on any time frame only indicates bears overweight bulls.

Additionally, the Indian Volatility Index (VIX) has spiked above 63.95 levels.

Earlier, we witnessed the same level of volatility in the year of 2008 and 2009. This observation indicates that further downward momentum with some wild swings cannot be ruled out.

Current chart formation suggests Nifty may find major support at around 8,000 level which is well supported by a December 2016 lows.

However, on the higher side, the index will continue to face hurdles around the 9,600 levels. In case of a sharp short-covering, Nifty may go to 10,200 level.

Here are two buy and one sell call for the next 3-4 weeks:

Bharat Electronics (BEL) | Buy | LTP: Rs 71.20 | Target: Rs 83.30 | Stop loss: Rs 69.50 | Upside: 17%

In the recent fall, the stock has drifted near its six-year low and formed a bullish Nen Star Harmonic Pattern on the weekly chart.

Previous week's candle was a bullish Dragonfly candlestick pattern.

The stock is trading above its potential reversal zone (PRZ) level. Prices have also formed Bullish Engulfing pattern on weekly time frame, which adds double confirmation to the prices.

Furthermore, momentum oscillator RSI (14) has witnessed Bullish Divergence near oversold zone and is currently reading near 30 levels on the weekly graph.

Traders can accumulate the stock in a range of Rs 74.20–75.25 for the target of Rs 83.30 with a stop loss below Rs 69.50 on a daily closing basis.

Minda Industries | Buy | LTP: Rs 255 | Target: Rs 296 | Stop loss: Rs 240 | Upside: 16%

The stock is trading in a broad range of consolidation for the last three years. Currently, prices are trading near the lower band of the rectangle pattern on the weekly time frame.

Prices are trading near its 50-month exponential moving average, which is acting as near-term support for the stock.

Momentum Oscillator RSI (14) has drifted below 20-level which is the extremely oversold level. It has also witnessed bullish divergence near oversold zone.

During October 2018, RSI had drifted below 20 levels and witnessed a sharp recovery in prices.

Traders can accumulate the stock in a range of Rs 255 - 259 for the target of Rs 296 with a stop loss below Rs 240 on a daily closing basis.

UPL | Sell | LTP: Rs 324.95 | Target: Rs 291 | Stop loss: Rs 338 | Downside: 10%

UPL has breached its almost four-year-long horizontal trend line and is currently trading below its support level on a weekly timeline.

Most indicators and oscillators are negatively poised and are looking week.

The stock has drifted below its 100-month exponential moving average on the monthly time frame, which indicates bears are in full control to push price lower.

Sharp fall in the stock has forced prices to breach below its July 2018 low. Traders can short the stock in a range of Rs 320 - 323 for the target of Rs 291 with a stop loss above Rs 338 on a daily closing basis.

The S&P BSE Sensex broke below 27,000 to hit a 38-month low, while the Nifty50 breached 7,900 levels for the first time since December 26, 2016.

The Indian rupee opened at record low of 74.95 per dollar on Thursday, down 69 paise against previous close 74.26.

We have collated a list of factors which could be weighing on markets:

Massive selling in global markets:

Asian stocks struggled on Thursday despite the announcement of stimulus from the European Central Bank but rising cases of coronavirus across the world capped the upside.

The ECB will buy 750 billion euro ($820 billion) in bonds through 2020, with Greek debt and non-financial commercial paper eligible under the programme for the first time, said a Reuters report.

Benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasuries, usually a haven in times of turmoil, suffered their sharpest two-day selloff in nearly 20 years.

Overnight on Wall Street, the S&P 500 fell 5 percent and is down nearly 30 percent over a month. The index has erased gains since President Donald Trump's 2017 inauguration, the Reuters report said.

Cut in earnings forecast:

Indian equity markets have corrected significantly so far in 2020 and especially in the past month in tandem with global equity markets due to headwinds from the Covid-19 outbreak across multiple countries.

The supply disruptions, as well as shrinking of demand, are a couple of factors that are likely to have bearing on the earnings for India Inc. suggest experts.

“We are assuming a 10% cut in Nifty earnings estimates for FY21 for valuation analysis. This is to factor in both global and local headwinds and disruptions owing to the outbreak of Covid-19,” Motilal Oswal said in a report.

“Global Cyclicals will see significant earnings downgrade given the sharp fall in commodity prices and expected moderation in global economic growth. The domestic economy facing sectors will also see downward revision in the earnings forecast due to restricted movements to prevent the outbreak of coronavirus,” it said.

Sombre global growth forecast -- may shrink to 1% in 2020

Following the coronavirus pandemic, global growth? may shrink to 1 percent in 2020, down from 2.3 percent before the outbreak started, as four major economies— Japan, Italy, Germany, France — are likely to experience a full-year recession, says a report.

According to The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), the situation appears grim in most countries around the world. As per its assumption, the virus will infect around 50 percent of the world population; 20 percent of the cases will be severe, and 1-3 percent will result in deaths.

Furthermore, this implies that Yes Bank may require more equity capital infusions to maintain regulatory capital adequacy,"" JM Financial said.
The bank will get Rs 10,000 crore capital infusion from State Bank of India (Rs 6,250 crore), ICICI Bank (Rs 1,000 crore), HDFC (Rs 1,000 crore), Kotak Mahindra Bank (Rs 500 crore), Axis Bank (Rs 600 crore), Bandhan Bank (Rs 300 crore), Federal Bank (Rs 300 crore) and IDFC First Bank (Rs 250 crore).
Hence, it continued to prefer larger banks (ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and Axis Bank) with better economies of scale, strong liability franchises and lower exposures to weaknesses in mid-corporates and SMEs.
""Moreover, these larger banks have seen sharp corrections and are now quoting at attractive valuations (ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and HDFC Bank trading at 1.2x, 1.5x and 2.5x FY21E BVPS for the core banking businesses),"" it said.","JM Financial says while the capital infusion and AT1 bonds write-off has helped Yes Bank stay afloat, its fundamentals remain weak.","Yes Bank is the biggest gainer in this falling market. The stock has gained 1,484 percent in just eight trading sessions as the cabinet approved the Reserve Bank of India's restructuring plan for the private lender.

The RBI, State Bank of India and new CEO & MD Prashant Kumar's assurances to depositors were enough to boost investors' confidence who bought the stock as other shares crashed over the coronavirus outbreak fears.

But brokerages are not convinced with this rally and some of them have suspended their coverage or maintained a “sell” rating on the stock.

JM Financial says the rally is more technical than fundamental, as while the capital infusion and AT1 bonds write-off has helped Yes Bank stay afloat, its fundamentals still remain weak.

The more than Rs 18,500 crore loss reported by the bank in Q3FY20 with pro-forma CET1 at 7.6 percent (post capital infusion and AT1 write-off) clearly shows the problem.

Gross non-performing loans (NPLs) for the bank were elevated at 18.9 percent as of Q3FY20, with provision coverage ratio (PCR) at 73 percent, and even so, the bank's press statement continued to guide for 5 percent slippages in FY21.

Further, the bank indicated that 60 percent of its corporate bond book was stressed and the PCR on the same was at 39 percent.

""As a result, we believe credit costs will continue to remain elevated for Yes bank in the medium term and the path to profitability may be prolonged. Furthermore, this implies that Yes Bank may require more equity capital infusions to maintain regulatory capital adequacy,"" JM Financial said.

The bank will get Rs 10,000 crore capital infusion from State Bank of India (Rs 6,250 crore), ICICI Bank (Rs 1,000 crore), HDFC (Rs 1,000 crore), Kotak Mahindra Bank (Rs 500 crore), Axis Bank (Rs 600 crore), Bandhan Bank (Rs 300 crore), Federal Bank (Rs 300 crore) and IDFC First Bank (Rs 250 crore).

The moratorium period, which included withdrawal of up to Rs 50,000, will end at 6 pm on March 18 after which Yes Bank will resume normal operations.

SBI has to keep at least a 26 percent stake in the bank for the next three years. Non-SBI investors will have a three-year lock-in for 75 percent of their investment.

""Interestingly at CMP, Yes Bank's new shareholders are sufficiently in-the-money to recover their entire investments by just offloading 17 percent of their allotted shares (since they invested at Rs 10 per share and CMP is Rs 59) versus the cap of 25 percent,"" the brokerage said.

""While investing banks have answered the call for capital from the regulator, we believe that they may look to offload Yes Bank shares once the allotted shares are eligible for trading,"" it added.

After the moratorium kicked in, a lot of mid and small sized banks saw sharp correction as well as flight-to-safety deposits to larger and “more stable” banks, though RBL Bank management said they were getting their deposits back and operations were normal.

Even Prashant Kumar said they saw more inflows than outflows in the last couple of days.

""Increasing risk aversion in the system has meant that smaller corporates/SMEs continue to struggle in terms of credit availability. In our view, the credit crunch in the economy could aggravate and thus could delay the growth recovery further,"" JM Financial said.

Credit costs may remain elevated, as systemic asset quality pressures for certain sectors persist, which may further be exacerbated by the Yes bank episode, the brokerage said.

Hence, it continued to prefer larger banks (ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and Axis Bank) with better economies of scale, strong liability franchises and lower exposures to weaknesses in mid-corporates and SMEs.

""Moreover, these larger banks have seen sharp corrections and are now quoting at attractive valuations (ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and HDFC Bank trading at 1.2x, 1.5x and 2.5x FY21E BVPS for the core banking businesses),"" it said.

"March 18, 2020 01:05 PM IST",-2,Sunil Matkar,"What should investors do as Nifty falls 3,800 points from record high?","The massive stimulus packages thus far however have failed to soothe the equity markets which have continued to bleed amidst extreme volatility.

The domestic market along with the global equity markets are going through a roller-coaster ride for the past few weeks, especially after central banks across the globe have announced measures to support their respective economies amid spread of novel coronavirus. The massive stimulus packages thus far however have failed to soothe the equity markets which have continued to bleed amidst extreme volatility.

In the month of March 2020, only in 12 trading days as on March 18, Indian benchmark indices have corrected over 23 percent as coronavirus outbreak, or COVID-19, has spread rapidly across more than 155 countries and has not shown any signs of containment. After China, infections have steadily risen in Iran, Italy, Japan and South Korea. India reported 147 confirmed cases on March 18, an increase from 6 on March 3.

The epidemic is having a major impact on global economy and the stock markets across the globe. As per a UN report the trade India figures among the top 15 economies most affected due to this pandemic as slowdown of manufacturing in China and shutdown across developed economies disrupts world trade.

China has become the central manufacturing hub of many global business operations and any disruption of China's output is expected to have repercussions elsewhere through regional and global value chains. Domestically the most affected sectors include precision instruments, machinery, automotive and communication equipment as these are heavily dependent on input from China.

Policymakers around the world are trying to contain the economic damage being caused by the spread of coronavirus. The IMF has already announced a $50-billion aid package to combat the impact of the coronavirus. Earlier the US Federal Reserve reduced interest rates by 50 basis points and in recent interest rate cut to near-zero on Sunday in another emergency move to help shore up the US economy amid the rapidly spreading global coronavirus pandemic.

In the past couple of weeks, Bank of Canada and Reserve Bank of Australia cut interest rates by 50bps each. South Korea proposed to inject $10 billion to support the economy and China allocated $16 billion for virus prevention. In India, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das also said there was a strong reason for coordinated policy action.

Before the COVID-19 the Indian economy appeared to have bottomed out, December quarter (Q3 FY20) GDP growth rate was along the expected lines. Services growth has continued to strengthen since November when it came out of a two-month spell of contraction. This has been in line with manufacturing activity, which mirrored a steep upward move of the growth curve in January when the PMI reached 55.3, the highest in nearly eight years.

However, the coronavirus impact on global growth and India's growth is a major factor that needs to be considered at this point in time. The positive side for Indian economy is that the significant correction in the crude oil prices has been a major impetus to the Indian economy as India imports 85 percent of its oil needs.

Indian equity markets do not have a clear direction at this point, and the near-term trajectory is being set by the developments around the COVID-19 spread. In the absence of any positive catalysts in the short term, the markets are at the mercy of COVID-19 spread, the markets are closely watching how the spread will progress and effectively be contained in Europe and North America.

The markets have effectively priced in the impact of this pandemic on global growth as of now, if the pandemic spread leads to further closure of developed economy including US we can expect significant downside even from here. Therefore our advice for investors is to desist from impulsive shopping in the equity markets just because the markets have corrected significantly.

The equity markets are forward-looking and the recent correction is factoring in the future earnings impairment due to the COVID-19 aftermath. It is also advisable to have enough dry powder in terms of cash handy which can be deployed swiftly if the correction deepens.

Although India has done a remarkable job thus far to effectively contain the spread of the virus, the next few weeks will be telling in how effective the government interventions have been. So far the markets have not witnessed any fiscal or monetary support in light of the Covid-19 spread as the government is more focused on containing the spread.

However, at some point the government would have to intervene along with the Central Bank to provide major relief to the economy through monetary and fiscal policy interventions, we expect that these interventions whenever they come would be positive catalysts for the Indian economy as well as the equity markets.

In light of these developments investors are advised to exercise caution in terms of their investments, just because the markets have corrected sharply does not mean that it is the right time to enter.

The right time would only arrive once the uncertainty around COVID-19 subsides, there has been some real damage that has occurred to the global economy due to this virus and that's what is being reflected in the current stock prices.

As an investment strategy, perhaps this is the time to start looking at individual names in select spaces that have seen significant corrections, banking is one sector that we are especially positive about after this correction, select names in the PSU banking space have reached attractive valuations and perhaps one can start creating small positions with a long term horizon.

Infrastructure is another space that we expect could see swift recovery once the dust settles, therefore select names in this space should be on the shopping list too. Hospitality, airlines, auto are some sectors that we expect would take a longer time to recover therefore investors are advised to stay away from these counters at this point.

The benchmark index NIFTY50 has already corrected more than 3400 points (28 percent) from its lifetime high and more pain is expected along the way. However, over the long term, equities have been among the top-performing asset classes even though equity investments come with intermittent short-term volatility/corrections.

It is advisable for investors to invest systematically into equities that too in quality stocks that have a visible and stable earnings outlook and good corporate governance track record with a long term investment horizon.

Citing adverse impact on the telecom and banking sectors, DoT also requested the SC to SC to modify its October 2019 AGR judgement and subsequent orders.

The apex court was hearing the Department of Telecommunications' (DoT) plea in regard to the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) case on March 17.

“All dues as per our judgement will have to be paid, including interest and penalty. The Solicitor General had filed a plea seeking reasonable time, we will consider this plea on the next date,” the order stated.

The order further stated that the court does “not appreciate telcos' actions and will hold MDs personally accountable.”

IndusInd Bank has around 2 percent exposure to Vodafone Idea which could find difficult to pay the entire amount on short notice. So far, Vodafone Idea had paid Rs 6,854 crore towards AGR dues, which is much lower than the demand of around Rs 53,000 crore made by Department of Telecommunications which included interest, penalty and interest on delay in payment of the amount.

On March 16, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta appearing for the DoT had sought staggered payment over 20 years of AGR dues by telecom companies. The plea also asked that telcos not be charged a penalty and interests on penalty and principal beyond the date of the judgement.

Telcos will instead be charged an 8 percent interest on the staggered payments, CNBC-TV18 reported. Seeking the apex court's approval, the DoT said the proposal was made based on a formula arrived at after detailed deliberations by the government and the Cabinet.

State Bank of India is ready to invest Rs 7,250 crore in Yes Bank, while ICICI bank, HDFC, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bandhan Bank, Axis Bank and Federal Bank will put in Rs 3,700 crore in the cash-starved lender.",,"Japanese brokerage firm Nomura has suspended the coverage of Yes Bank, saying the private lender was damaged beyond repair.

Though the government took over the bank to prevent a collapse and the Reserve Bank of India has come with a restructuring plan for the lender, Nomura seems unimpressed.

""While Yes Bank's going concern risk is now minimised post RBI's restructuring plan (Rs 10,000 crore of capital infusion by banks), in our view the bank is damaged beyond repair to fundamentally evaluate any business/investment case,"" the brokerage said.

Nomura says Yes Bank will remain on life support for a long time and is clearly not out of the woods, given the +10x dilution by FY21F (5x in phase-1 of the restructuring plan), significant deterioration operationally, permanent damage to its liability profile, 75 percent of shares held locked in for three years and weak capital levels (CET-1 of 7.6% post planned infusion) as well as impending stress that was yet be recognised.

Hence, the brokerage suspended its coverage of the stock.

The country's fourth largest private sector lender on March 14 reported a loss of Rs 18,564 crore in the quarter ended December 2019 compared with the profit of Rs 1,001.8 crore a year ago, dented by significant rise in bad loans and severe fall in deposit base.

It reported an operational loss of Rs 6.42 crore in Q3FY20, impacted by slippages of Rs 24,600 crore – NIMs compressed by 190bp QoQ to 1.4 percent. The bank's liability profile deteriorated sharply, with deposit book shrinking by Rs 44,000 crore QoQ and loan book by 17 percent QoQ (24 percent YoY).

""Deposit run-down will continue especially post- moratorium and with smaller balance size and lower opex levers, we expect operating profitability to be dramatically impacted,"" said the brokerage.

Asset quality also deteriorated sharply, with gross non-performing assets (NPAs) inching to 18.9 percent led by Rs 24,600 crore of slippages.

The bank did further guide towards an additional 5 percent slippages (Rs 9,000 crore) in FY21F (total GNPA of Rs 50,000 crore) against a total stress book of around Rs 75,000 crore.

""While the bank did ramp up its provision cover to 73 percent but with balance-sheet size shrinking, the left-over book will remain highly toxic, making any recovery in profitability very difficult, in our view,"" Nomura said.

With a loss of over Rs 18,000 crore, CET-1 was reduced to 0.6 percent and despite Rs 10,000 crore of capital infusion by banks as well as Rs 8,400 crore of AT-1 write down, CET-1 of 7.6 percent was weak and would require continued capital support, the brokerage said.

""We have seen no private interest so far in the bank and given the deterioration in the business, banks/RBI will have to continue to provide both liquidity and capital to the bank,"" it said.

Yes Bank expects pressures from sour loans, which led it to declare the highest loss for the December quarter, to continue even in FY21, but CEO-designate Prashant Kumar is confident of its survival after a Rs 10,000-crore capital infusion.

State Bank of India is ready to invest Rs 7,250 crore in Yes Bank, while ICICI bank, HDFC, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Bandhan Bank, Axis Bank and Federal Bank will put in Rs 3,700 crore in the cash-starved lender.

The moratorium period, which started on March 6, ends mid week and the new board will be formed within seven days.

Prabhudas Lilladher also suspended its rating on the stock after the third quarter loss. ""Deposit outflow behaviour post moratorium lifting will be important event and with statutory ratios below prescribed levels it is difficult to project any direction. Rating suspended,"" it said.

The brokerage also said though the bank had got fresh capital from other banks of Rs 10,000 crore under the reconstruction scheme but it wasn't enough.

""The bank will need further capital infusions as some part of loans are still stressed and shrinkage in balance sheet will not keep operating profit at pace, but good part is most of the pain has been recognized with strong 72 percent PCR and hence we may see other investors support as well,"" it added.

Historical data of the past 20 years suggests markets usually create a bottom after falling around 39 percent on average.

The Nifty50 has declined more than 30 percent in the last three months.

In the last 2 decades, there have been six instances when the market corrected by 25 percent or more, ICICIdirect said in a report.

Out of 6, in four instances correction was more than 30%. In all four instances, one year and two year forward returns for Nifty have been positive, the report added.

Despite a coordinated response from global central bankers to stem the slowdown and avoid a possible recession, there is a risk-off sentiment in equity markets across the globe which is pushing money out of riskier assets to safe-havens.

Coronavirus scare has grown multi-fold post its spread across the key economic zone of Europe and the US. The number of affected cases in India is not significant but they are rising which does pose a challenge for the government.

The outbreak of the coronavirus will definitely have an overall impact on global as well as Indian GDP growth in the interim. But, investors have seen a similar situation in the past, and the big takeaway is investing in this market in a staggered way, will create wealth.

“Historically, it has been seen that market recovery in such a case is usually sharp and quick and precedes the economic growth rebound. Therefore, we see the current correction as a buying opportunity for the investors who should utilise the declines to lap up good businesses which have comfortable leverage, strong return ratios and enjoy leadership position,” ICICIdirect said in a report.

“The allocation, however, can either be made in staggered or in lump sum, depending on investor's risk appetite,” the report added.

The last major correction which lasted about 10 months was seen in the market back in 2008 when Nifty lost more than 60 percent of its value.

The fall which started from January and lasted till October gave long-term investors a good buying opportunity because the rally was fierce in the next 1 year as the index rose more than 100 percent.",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/multibagger-opportunity-a-30-market-fall-in-past-generated-wealth-in-subsequent-year-5037861.html

Hero MotoCorp share price was up 4 percent after Kota Institutional Equities upgraded the stock to an “add” from a “sell”. The brokerage firm has fixed the fair value of the stock at Rs 2,150, a 20 percent upside from the current market price.

""We upgrade the stock to 'add' from 'sell' on attractive valuations (11 times FY2022E core EPS).

Brokerages point out that the sharp decline in crude prices will further dent crude derivative prices, some of which had already reached 4-year lows in February 2020.
While crude prices touch new lows, there are no triggers for natural and synthetic rubber prices to go up as well.
Moreover, as per the brokerage, global benchmark natural rubber prices have seen a nearly 5 percent correction over average prices of Q3FY20.
A lot will depend on the auto sector for the tyre-makers to reap the benefits of plunging crude oil prices.",The tailwind for tyre sector is expected to continue as long as the coronavirus issue does not come under control. Brokerages point out that the sharp decline in crude prices will further dent crude derivative prices.,"A sharp plunge in the global crude oil prices is expected to augur well for domestic tyre manufacturers as one of the key raw materials for tyre-making is derived from crude.

Brent Crude oil prices have plunged more than 50 percent so far in 2020 to a fresh 4-year low amid fears of an economic recession due to coronavirus outbreak.

In normal circumstances, a fall in global crude oil prices is positive for sectors like tyre, paint and aviation and even the domestic economy in general as India is one of the largest importers of crude oil in the world.

A fall in crude simply means strong margin tailwinds for tyre-makers and margins are big levers for the earnings growth of domestic tyre companies as they do not pass on the full impact of increase or decrease in raw material prices in the replacement market.

Tailwind likely to continue

The tailwind for tyre sector is expected to continue as long as the coronavirus issue does not come under control. Brokerages point out that the sharp decline in crude prices will further dent crude derivative prices, some of which had already reached 4-year lows in February 2020.

""Crude derivatives constitute nearly 30 percent of sales for domestic tyre companies, and therefore a sharp decline in crude prices would buoy their margins,"" said brokerage firm Equirus Securities in a report on March 16.

The brokerage firm underscored that tyre companies had reported strong FY17 margins due to a sharp decline in raw materials.

Before slump in crude last week, some crude derivatives – styrene, butadiene and carbon black feed oil – had already gone to FY17 levels. With a further correction in crude prices, crude derivatives will decline even more and there will be a gradual margin gain over Q1FY21 and Q2FY21, Equirus Securities said.

Stock market expert SP Tulsian of sptulsian.com expressed similar views in a recent interview with CNBC-TV18.

""If you take a call on the falling crude, that will be seen positive for all the tyre-makers as the synthetic rubber prices are falling. Taking that into account, I have a positive view of the tyre stocks,"" Tulsian had said.

While crude prices touch new lows, there are no triggers for natural and synthetic rubber prices to go up as well.

Equirus highlighted that synthetic rubber, which is nearly 10 percent of sales, is mainly made of compounds, styrene and butadiene. Prices of both these compounds were already at a four-year low before a slump in crude prices this week; these can decline further going ahead.

Prices of carbon black fuel oil – a key raw material for making carbon black – declined 37 percent year-on-year (YoY) in Q3FY20 and can correct further going ahead. Other rubber chemical prices should also decline with crude prices, Equirus pointed out.

Moreover, as per the brokerage, global benchmark natural rubber prices have seen a nearly 5 percent correction over average prices of Q3FY20. Global demand is expected to remain muted with the impact of Coronavirus; hence, there are no upside triggers for natural rubber prices.

Equirus has a 'buy' call on Apollo Tyres, with a target price of Rs 197 and has a 'long' call on Balkrishna Industries, with a target price of Rs 1,329.

CEAT and MRF also have 'long' calls from Equirus with a target price of Rs 983 and Rs 70,857, respectively.

But some challenges persist

Tulsian of sptulsian.com added that that the rise in tyre stocks has to be linked with the revival in the auto cycle.

The auto sector is marred with challenges that were aggravated by the outbreak of coronavirus. A lot will depend on the auto sector for the tyre-makers to reap the benefits of plunging crude oil prices.

Sameer Kalra, Founder of Target Investing said CV sales are low and now BS-VI overhang is there. Besides, lower capacity utilisation at fleet operators impacts aftermarket sales of tyres.

Kalra has a negative view on the sector.

During FY20, volume growth for tyre companies was negative-to-flat due to a sharp decline in original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).

Brokerage Equirus point out that with trucks being the industry's largest segment, and dependent on the economy, aftermarket volume growth is also impacted.

""With the economy expected to remain sluggish, we believe volume growth for the industry will remain muted. However, a sharp decline in crude prices gives the government some room to revive growth through investment; however, we will have to wait and watch how the government intervenes in this scenario,"" Equirus said.

Edited excerpt:

Q) Lower circuit on D-Street and then some recovery. What is the way ahead for markets in the near term?

A) After a sharp correction of 10 percent on the US benchmark DJIA overnight accompanied by coronavirus terror, Indian bourses opened on the same note with a lower circuit of 10 percent and made a low of 8,555.

As per the regulatory norms, trading was halted for 45 minutes and resumed at 10.00 A.M. with steadiness. Indian Benchmarks recovered the entire 10 percent loss.

Since the recovery was V-shaped and coronavirus issue is still intact, volatility may remain for some more days and the Nifty50 will trade in a broad range of 8,458-11,750.

A) The Nifty50 has a Fibonacci retracement of 38.2 percent at 8,458 of its past 11 years upside trend which is said to be 'golden support'.

Going forward, a move below the level of 8555 can lead to the next support of 8458- 7327 whereas if the index manages to close above 10,165 then the upside resistance is placed at 10,290 -11,095.

A) Global stock market posts the biggest sell-off since the 2008 financial crisis thus fear of 2008 crisis is apparent among the market players.

The brokerage firm has fixed the fair value of the stock at Rs 2,150, a 20 percent upside from the current market price.

With this, the stock broke the losing streak of the last three consecutive sessions.

The stock of the country's largest two-wheeler maker rose in line with a rise in the broader market, which analysts termed as value buying.

In a report on March 16, Kota Institutional Equities upgraded Hero MotoCorp to an “add” from a “sell”. The brokerage firm has fixed the fair value of the stock at Rs 2,150, a 20 percent upside from the current market price.

The stock has been under pressure for reasons varying from economic slowdown to regulatory and technological shift. The stock is trading 41 percent lower from its 52-week high level.

Upgrading the stock, Kotak said its valuation made it attractive.

""We upgrade the stock to 'add' from 'sell' on attractive valuations (11 times FY2022E core EPS). While the catalysts for near- term growth are absent due to impact on consumption because of Covid-19 and shift to BS-VI norms from April 2020, we believe growth will resume for the company from the second half of FY21 led by a revival in rural demand,"" Kotak said.

Kotak highlighted that Hero had maintained its market share in the domestic motorcycle segment in the past six years despite concerns of escalating competition from Bajaj Auto.

The brokerage, however, cut the earnings estimates due to shrinking volume and profitability in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.

""We have cut our earnings estimates by 9-13 percent for FY2021-22E due to cut in our volume estimates and profitability due to concerns on Covid-19 outbreak and a sharp rise in costs related to BS-VI norms,"" Kotak said.

""We have thus cut our fair value to Rs 2,150 from Rs 2,550 earlier, which is based on 13 times March 2022E core EPS, excluding cash and cash equivalents.""

The stock trades at an FCF yield of 5-7 percent in FY2021-22E and Kotak said the company can deliver a 5-7 percent volume CAGR over the next 10 years.

The company had reported a 19.27 percent decline in sales at 4,98,242 units in February.

The road ahead looks tough as the coronavirus outbreak has impacted production.

In February, the company commenced dispatches of five new BS-VI products including some of its key products like the Splendor+, Super Splendor, Glamour and Passion Pro motorcycles and Maestro Edge 125 and Destini 125 scooters.

After opening a tad higher on March 17, the Indian market gave up all the gains and slid sharply in the last hour of trade with Nifty closing below 9,000 levels and Bank Nifty below 22,200 levels as fears over the coronavirus pandemic loomed over the market.

On the technical front, Nifty has slid below its 100-days exponential moving average on monthly charts which can trigger further selling pressure into the prices in coming sessions once again.

On the derivatives front, the heavy short build-up has been witnessed into the index from the last few sessions, which will once again limit any sharp upside into the prices.

On the higher side, as long as Nifty is trading below the psychological level of 10,000, the undertone will likely to remain bearish and any bounce into the prices should be used for creating fresh shorts.

Additionally, the Indian Volatility Index (VIX) has spiked above 60 levels which also indicates further downward momentum with some wild swings on the cards.

Here are three sell recommendations for the next 3-4 weeks:

Nestle India | Sell | LTP: Rs 14,573.95 | Target price: Rs 13,700 | Stop loss: Rs 15,100 | Downside: 6%

The stock has witnessed a series of decline from the last few sessions and slid below its 100-days exponential moving average on a daily interval which is placed at 15,064 levels.

At the current juncture, prices are trading in a downward sloping channel with the formation of the lower bottom pattern. The immediate support for the stock is placed at Rs 14,000 below which further downside should resume in coming sessions.

So, traders can short sell the stock in the range of Rs 14,540-14,600 for the downside target of Rs 13,700 with stop loss

above Rs 15,100.

Maruti Suzuki India | Sell | LTP: Rs 5,600 | Target price: Rs 5,000 | Stop loss: Rs 6,000 | Downside: 11%

After consolidating in the range of Rs 7,000 to Rs 7,500 levels, the stock has given a sharp breakdown below its 200-days exponential moving average on the daily charts and went below Rs 5,000 levels to mark its 52-week low of Rs 4,803 on March 13.

However, due to short-covering, once again prices are holding above Rs 5,600 at the current juncture but the broader structure is still weak as prices are holding well below its short and long-term moving averages.

On a shorter time frame, the stock has formed a rounding top pattern which could trigger another round of downside momentum into the prices in the coming sessions.

Traders can short sell the stock in the range of Rs 5,600-5,650 for the downside target of Rs 5,000 with a stop loss above Rs 6,000.

NTPC | Sell | LTP: Rs 88.05 | Target price: Rs 78 | Stop loss: Rs 100 | Downside: 11%

The stock can be seen maintaining its downtrend and falling in a sloping channel with the formation of the lower high and lower bottom pattern.

A few weeks back, the fresh breakdown was observed below the descending triangle pattern which triggered the follow-up selling into the stock as prices breached the psychological level of Rs 100-mark as the stock tested its 52-week low of Rs 81.25 last week.

Now once again, marginally higher volumes have been witnessed at the current juncture with a fall in price which should move the stock towards new lows in the coming sessions.

Traders can short sell the stock in the range of Rs 89-92 for the downside target of Rs 78 with a stop loss above Rs 100.

It is very likely that the Nifty50 could well recover from here and not plunge further to lower levels, he added.

Edited excerpt:

A. The lower circuit on March 13 was imposed when markets came down 10 percent from the previous close. However, after hitting the circuit, value buying came into the market which led to its recovery along with strong global cues.

The near-term looks promising in the market, investors must watch out for the levels of 9,800 which will be a crucial support and 10,500 will act as a resistance in the short-term.

Q. Sensex and Nifty are officially in the bear market along with their global peers. Historical data suggests that Nifty witnessed a fall of 25-28 percent before bouncing back. Do you think this time as well, the downside is fairly limited from here?

A. Nifty and Sensex have fallen 22-25 percent approximately from their respective record highs, and therefore, by seeing historical patterns and sharp recovery in the March 13 session, it is only fair to assume that recovery can be seen.

This downfall was in response to the negative global sentiment and panic after Coronavirus was declared a pandemic.

Investors should understand that it is not that businesses' are doing bad or there is something extremely wrong with the economy to cause such a huge fall over the last few trading sessions.

It is very likely that the Nifty50 could well recover from here and not plunge further to lower levels.

Q. What does your experience of bear markets tell you — time to catch the fear? Investors who put in money around the time the market hit lower circuit, say 2008, have created massive wealth over a period of time. Do you think we are in a similar situation?

A. Between May 2008 and February 2009, the S&P 500 lost nearly half of its value. In the following five years, it gained more than 153 percent.

Any investor who has entered the market during the above period would have received decent profits at attractive valuations.

The lower circuit in the Indian markets was triggered, for the first time in 12 years, on March 13, 2020 since the 2008 global financial crisis.

After the trading was halted, following a circuit breaker within five minutes of trade, Sensex and Nifty made recoveries in their days' losses, which was the biggest intraday recovery by the markets.

Fall in the Indian indices has been lower than the stock market in other countries. This is a good time to begin accumulating stocks as valuations are fairly attractive now.

The situation is not similar to the 2008 crisis as then, it was due to the liquidity crisis across the globe and the current decline in capital markets is due to negative sentiments of the investors. In situations like this, recovery is usually very fast as people are selling emotionally.

Q. What are you suggesting to your clients — sit tight or buy in a staggered way?

A. Investors should consider investing in a staggered manner rather than investing their entire capital in a single stock or sector. This would help them diversify their risk as well as maximize their returns in case of uncertainty. People can consider investing across various sectors or benchmark indices as per convenience.

Q. The good news is that mutual funds are still receiving inflows which means that investors still trust equities despite massive selloff. Do you think the trend will continue or you see redemption pressure in MF sooner or later?

A. This increased inflow, especially from DIIs, points to one thing and that is their consistent faith of investors in equities, despite massive selloff investors are seeing an opportunity for value buying.

Investors who have made value buying are not ones with short term views or goals, these investors will hold their investment for the long-term and it is unlikely that the majority of investors will try to redeem their MF units in near future.

Q. Where is the value in this market? Most of the stocks are available at multi-year lows. How should investors decide which one is a better value play?

A. It can be observed that most of the stocks have touched their multi-year lows this week and are trading below their 200-Days EMA.

The current decline in capital markets is due to the negative sentiments of the investors and has nothing to do with the financial performance of most of the stocks.

In such a situation, investors should be careful in choosing the stocks before investing.

Analysing the fundamentals as well as the future projects of the firm would help apart from considering the technical aspects. Consumption stocks will give the opportunity for value buying.

Q. Any five stocks which you like to recommend to your readers and why?

A. Here is a list of top five stocks which investors can look at buying after the recent fall:

HDFC Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,071 | Target: Rs 1,170 | Stop Loss: Rs 999 | Upside 9%

HDFC Bank Ltd holds a weightage of around 10 percent in the Nifty 50. The stock gained more than 4 percent after the trading was halted on March 13

It also has a gap on the upper side. Technical indicators signal a reversal in this stock. We recommend buying the stock above Rs 1082 with a stop loss of 999 and a target of Rs 1170.

Q. Is it a bad deal for shareholders of Yes Bank? What should investors who are invested in Kotak, HDFC, SBI and Axis Bank do?

A. The infusion of nearly Rs 3,100 crores of funds in Yes Bank is a positive sign and it is a fair deal for shareholders of Yes Bank as the bank will be able to resume operations much more effectively and with other noteworthy banks as its shareholders.

These banks can always monitor the business and take care of it in case of any deviation from standards. For investors, who are invested in Kotak, HDFC, SBI and Axis bank this decision may generate mixed feelings.

This may be beneficial in the long run as equity invested in Yes Bank will also appreciate as the investment value of these investors will also rise and hence increasing the value.

REUTERS

Tracking sell-off in global equities, Indian market witnessed a knee-jerk reaction on March 16 pushing Sensex and Nifty50 below crucial support levels. The S&P BSE Sensex broke below 32,000 levels while the Nifty50 closed below 9,200 levels.

The benchmark indices saw the second biggest single-day loss today. The BSE Sensex was down 2,713.41 points or 7.96 percent at 31,390.07, while the Nifty50 crashed 757.80 points or 7.61 percent to 9,197.40.

The market breadth remained negative as about 5 shares declined for every share rising on the BSE.

The Indian rupee closed lower by 36 paise at 74.27 per dollar against Friday's close 73.91.

On the sectoral front, selling pressure was seen in banks, FMCG, IT, auto, metals, pharma and realty which all fell 4-9 percent.

We have collated a list of top factors which could be weighing on markets:

Global trend remains weak:

After a swift rally seen in US markets on Friday, things were looking promising for a stable Monday morning. But, Asian markets were trading weak tracking sharp selloff in Dow Futures.

US stock futures plunged 4.6 percent to hit their down limit and European markets were down 7-10 percent. at 16 hours IST.

Australia's benchmark stock index fell 9.7 percent at close. Japan's Nikkei, South Korea's KOSPI, China's Shanghai Composite and Hong Kong's Hang Seng were down 2.5-4 percent.

US Fed's emergency cut spooks investors:

The US Federal Reserve and global central banks moved aggressively on Sunday to buttress a world economy unraveling rapidly amid the coronavirus pandemic, with the Fed slashing interest rates to near zero, said a Reuters report.

The US Fed slashed short-term rates to a target range of zero percent to 0.25 percent, and announcing at least $700 billion in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities purchases in the coming weeks.

Depository institutions may borrow from this so-called discount window for periods as long as 90 days, pre-payable and renewable by the borrower on a daily basis.

“The Fed also said it would support U.S. banks that began to tap the capital and liquidity buffers they built up in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and would reduce reserve requirement ratios to zero percent effective on March 26,” said the report.

Oil extends slide! Nears $30 a barrel

Crude Oil prices extended losses on Monday, slumping by more than $3.5 a barrel. Fall in crude oil prices suggests slowdown globally. Generally, an orderly decline in crude oil prices, which if occurs due to increased supply, is beneficial for the domestic economy, but in case of fears of a global slowdown it will result in a fall in equities as well.

""During the global financial crisis 2008, crude oil prices plunged nearly 70 percent in a span of seven months on demand concerns as the subprime crisis threatened the global economy and financial system,"" Praveen Singh, AVP, Fundamental Research – Commodities, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas told Moneycontrol.

Yes Bank's restructuring plan involving the capital infusion of Rs 7,250 crore by SBI, Rs 1,000 crore, each, by HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank, Rs 600 crore by Axis Bank and Rs 500 crore by Kotak Bank has come as a big relief.

Many more institutions have shown willingness to invest. The restructuring plan involving the country's leading banks will go a long way in instilling confidence in the embattled Yes bank. However, there is a risk that depositors might flee once the caps on withdrawals are lifted. Bulk depositors should be persuaded to stay.

The restructuring of Yes Bank has to be seen in the light of failures of the NBFCs, IL&FS and DHFL and the crisis in banks like PMC Bank and PNB. It is also important to recognise the fact that during the last eight years, the government has recapitalised India's PSU banks to the tune of Rs 3.5 lakh crore at the taxpayers' expense. Aren't we paying too high a price for financial failures? Who all are responsible? What lessons can we learn? These are the relevant questions.

The fact that the health of the financial system is crucial for economic growth and development needs no emphasis. Financial history is filled with examples of failures of financial institutions wreaking havoc in the real economy. That's why we have institutions for regulation and supervision, credit rating, auditing and many norms and guidelines for healthy practices. India has adopted most of these best practices. In spite of all these, why did Yes Bank fail?

What led to the crisis?

There have been serious lapses at many levels - in regulation and supervision, in auditing and in the functioning of the board. It is surprising that the abnormally high credit growth of Yes Bank relative to the growth of the industry, and the increasingly high proportion of fee income, particularly from new corporate borrowers, had escaped the attention of regulators for long. If a bank with a capital adequacy of 16.5 percent and gross NPAs of only 3.22 percent as late as March 2019, fail within a year, questions have to be raised on the quality of auditing and supervision. The Q3 FY20 loss of 18,564.2 crore, against a profit of Rs 1,000 crore during the corresponding period last year, is a reflection of failures at all levels.

Guilty should not go scot-free

Unfortunately, our experience is that financial manipulators go scot-free. This should change. A lapse in the Yes Bank episode is that Rana Kapoor could sell his stake in the bank even after he was shown the door. Many murky stories involving the promoters and the new breed of corporate borrowers are coming to light. All sorts of nexus have to be enquired and the guilty punished expeditiously. Regulators, auditors, independent directors and rating agencies have to be pro-active to pre-empt crisis. The stability of the financial system demands eternal vigilance.

Shares of the private lender have been under pressure following concerns about the bank's health.

According to reports, the bank's promoters, the Hinduja brothers, are fully backing the lender and attribute the latest decline in the stock to excessive speculative action.

CEO Romesh Sobti wrote to investors that rumours about the health of the bank were unfounded and that IndusInd ""remains focussed on building scale with profitability, on a platform of strong capitalisation/liquidity and high credit ratings"".

The state of some private banks in India has customers and investors worried after authorities were forced to step in and curtail operations of Yes Bank to prevent a collapse.

In his letter to customers, Sobti said IndusInd remained healthy and also denied that the bank was considering investing in Yes Bank.

Sobti said that the bank had neither considered nor evaluated, especially at management and board level, such a proposition.

What are brokerages saying?

Emkay Global maintains a sell call on the stock saying that sustainable revival will need many more steps, including continued capital support.

The must-have strategy to contain deposits run-down, and it will be a long battle for the bank to survive and thrive independently, the report added.

For SBI, the current reconstruction scheme takes away the immediate risk of a merger, and we hope that similar reconstruction schemes will be worked out for other weak private banks, Emkay said.

Edelweiss has kept its rating under review as the reconstruction scheme is novel, but the brokerage firm expects collateral damage. The moratorium has shaken the stakeholders' confidence. Hence, deposit outflow is imminent once the moratorium is lifted.

“The 3-year lock-in for existing shareholders would dent investor confidence. The markdown of AT1 bonds challenges the underlying premise of these instruments. The medium-term issues pertaining to customers & employees are key risks,” the report said.

SBI Card, a 2 decade old business engaged in issuing credit cards to consumers in India, stands the 2nd largest credit card issuer in India, being one of the leading providers of credit cards with 18.1 percent market share of the Indian credit card market in terms of the number of credit cards outstanding and 17.9 percent market share of the Indian credit card market in terms of total credit card spends 2019.
""SBI Card has very strong fundamentals and healthy growth prospects considering low penetration in India and sourcing from existing SBI clients.""
SBI Card launched the IPO for subscription during March 2-5 and garnered Rs 10,340 crore from investors.
Hardayal Prasad, MD & CEO at SBI Cards & Payment Services remains confident about credit card industry growth going ahead.","The company has sound fundamentals and growth potential, therefore patient investors can hold it for the long term or till they make sufficient gains on their positions, Nirali Shah said.","The listing of SBI Cards and Payment Services was largely on expected lines given the market turmoil which wiped out around Rs 36 lakh crore of investor wealth in about 2 months due to novel coronavirus spread.

The stock opened nearly 13 percent lower at Rs 658 on the BSE against issue price of Rs 755. It managed to hit its issue price intraday in morning trade, but could not hold the same for long.

At the time of publishing this copy, it was trading at Rs 730, down 3.3 percent from IPO price. The total traded share volume on exchanges stood at around 4.8 lakh crore so far.

Given the weak market conditions, most experts advised selling shares of SBI Card now and holding cash to buy the same later once the coronavirus-led dust settles down as they all are bullish on the stock for long term.

""We suggest investors who receive allotment may exit once at listing price,"" Manali Bhatia, Senior Research Analyst at Rudra Shares & Stock Brokers told Moneycontrol.

Gaurav Garg, Head of Research at CapitalVia Global Research Limited- Investment Advisor and Prashanth Tapse, AVP Research at Mehta Equites also said investors should try to book listing gains for the time being and prefer to seat in liquid cash position than holding the stock.

Investors should wait for the right opportunity to add the stock to portfolio in staggered manner in any dip, both advised. Participants who are also looking for liquidity can sell the stock on listing amidst poor market sentiments and uncertainty, Nirali Shah, Senior Research Analyst at Samco Securities said.

As far as the buying on listing day is concerned, Manali Bhatia said investor may wait for the price to get stable & can be bought to the levels of Rs 650-700 per share on the listing day.

All analysts or every investor remains bullish on the stock with a long term perspective given the expected robust growth in credit card industry, though there is a panic-led correction in the stock for short term.

""Given top 4 players including State Bank of India dominating more than 70 percent market share (FY19), SBI's strong parentage, sound fundamentals, niche business and extreme growth outlook, SBI Card to command high P/E and will get advantage for the same. We still remain bullish for the stock for the price target of Rs 1,250 in next 1 year,"" said Manali Bhatia.

Gaurav Garg expects double-digit return in the stock for next five years, based on strong financials and its prospects of growing credit card market.

""Amidst global turmoil, one should wait and not jump on the listing day, as stock may face correction and investor may get opportunities to accumulate it later. We expect a target of 1,100 for next one year on the stock,"" he said.

SBI Card, a 2 decade old business engaged in issuing credit cards to consumers in India, stands the 2nd largest credit card issuer in India, being one of the leading providers of credit cards with 18.1 percent market share of the Indian credit card market in terms of the number of credit cards outstanding and 17.9 percent market share of the Indian credit card market in terms of total credit card spends 2019.

SBI Cards has a diversified customer acquisition network across multiple channels and open market point of sales & access to extensive network of SBI's vast customer base of 44.55 crore customers.

""The company has sound fundamentals and growth potential, therefore patient investors can hold it for the long term or till they make sufficient gains on their positions. Given the current scenario, it might take some time before the stock makes a good 15-20 percent returns. But one should not enter new positions at least till the dust settles,"" Nirali Shah said.

According to Prashanth Tapse, if in any case the listing goes discount by 10-15 percent to issue price one can look for accumulate phasewise for those investors with long term view for a one year target Rs 1,100-1,150.

""We assume favourable industry growth dynamics with strong levers like rising discretionary spends and significantly underpenetrated Indian credit card industry in place to drive sustainable, profitable growth gives SBI Cards a competitive advantage for long term play,"" he reasoned.

Jaikishan Parmar, Senior Equity Research Analyst at Angel Broking also said long term investors should not worry as over the long term price will follow the fundamental of the SBI Card. ""SBI Card has very strong fundamentals and healthy growth prospects considering low penetration in India and sourcing from existing SBI clients.""

SBI Card launched the IPO for subscription during March 2-5 and garnered Rs 10,340 crore from investors. Parent State Bank of India reduced its stake in SBI Card to around 70 percent and global investor CA Rover, an affiliate of Carlyle Group, to around 16 percent post issue.

Hardayal Prasad, MD & CEO at SBI Cards & Payment Services remains confident about credit card industry growth going ahead.

""We need to consider a lot of the growth has come due to digitalisation right from demonetisation and due to launch of different products, people are confident about making payment through credit cards or lowering cash payments,"" he said in an interview to CNBC-TV18.

Prasad feels that the credit card industry is yet to realise its full potential as most people in India still use cash for most day-to-day transactions.

""Hence, we will still continue to see good growth as cash payment system has slowly been moving to credit cards.""

""I don't look at industry numbers, but the main thing is we listen to consumers, we come out with different products. If a company will be able to do that, digitise, then that will help credit card growth story to continue and I will be very realistic about robust growth ahead,"" he said.

Stocks like Kotak Mahindra Bank, TCS, Dabur, Bajaj Finance, Titan and HUL can possibly turn out as wealth creators for the next decade, Umesh Mehta, Head of Research, Samco Securities., said in an interview with Moneycontrol's Kshitij Anand.

edited excerpts:

A) The one rule for investors in panic is BUY. The market-wide lower freeze is the loudest signal Mr Market is giving with fear at its peak. No one is buying and therefore it is the signal of the decade to buy.

We think such panic bottoms are a great opportunity to buy quality stocks. The near term bounces will keep on happening, but eventually, volatility will subside and markets will give opportunities to ""accumulate"". For investors, this is a buy on dips opportunity.

A) Currently, markets are largely driven by fear of survival. The fear should now subside as we think it peaked on Friday morning.

This is a textbook type ideal situation to go contra and start accumulating businesses as these kinds of falls let you acquire a slice of India's future at a marked-down price.

As such, there is no 20 percent definition and it can vary from cases to cases. However, the real crux is to identify the peak in fear psychology, which most likely the market registered early on Friday morning.

Q) What does your experience of bear markets tell you? Investors who put in money around the time when the market hit lower circuit say 2008, they have created massive wealth over a period of time. Do you think we are in a similar situation?

A) Ideally, the best time to invest is when fear grips the market. The downfall is purely sentimental rather than being backed by deteriorating fundamental business prospects.

2008 and 2020 are dramatically different events with the same outcome; catastrophic market declines due to the looming fears of survival.

Such situations for whatever reasons are always great opportunities for investors to accumulate quality stocks.

Q) What are you advising your clients – sit tight or but in a staggered way?

A) Such times of extreme pessimism carry along with them an ideal opportunity to go contra and start accumulating quality businesses where businesses are resilient and supported by steady cash generations.

For conservative investors, it would be advisable to start deploying savings to start investing in compounders in a SIP (staggered) mode.

Q) The good news is that MF are still receiving inflows which means that investors still trust equities despite massive sell-off. Do you think the trend will continue or you see redemption pressure in MF sooner or later?

A) Given the fact that mutual funds inflows are still intact despite the massive selloff, speaks much about the maturity of investors and investor awareness campaigns that the association is running.

It all depends on how the health concerns are addressed by the government. China is slowly turning to normalcy. Hopefully, India too will be able to manage the crises well. Equities will still remain the mainstay for investors and confidence will return soon.

Q) Where is value in this market? Most of the stocks are available at multi-year lows – how should investors decide which one is a better value play?

A) In times of extreme pessimism, every market constituent, in general, will look for a value play. But, it is sound enough to categorically disperse genuine value bargains from value traps.

Empirical evidence suggests that buying compounders in such panics rewards the investors handsomely and buying cyclical will give massive alphas to traders in the medium term.

Buying leaders in FMCG, Pvt banks, Consumer durables and IT will be the best strategy for investors.

Q) Any five stocks which you like to recommend to your readers and why?

A) Given the recent correction, one should plan to invest in resilient businesses with predictable earnings and massive perceived earnings growth. Stocks like Kotak Mahindra Bank, TCS, Dabur, Bajaj Finance, Titan and HUL can possibly turn out as wealth creators for the next decade.
